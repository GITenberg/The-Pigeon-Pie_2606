<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the September of the year
1651 the afternoon sun was shining pleasantly into the
dining-hall of Forest Lea House.&nbsp; The sunshine came through
a large bay-window, glazed in diamonds, and with long branches of
a vine trailing across it, but in parts the glass had been broken
and had never been mended.&nbsp; The walls were wainscoted with
dark oak, as well as the floor, which shone bright with rubbing,
and stag&rsquo;s antlers projected from them, on which hung a
sword in its sheath, one or two odd gauntlets, an old-fashioned
helmet, a gun, some bows and arrows, and two of the broad shady
hats then in use, one with a drooping black feather, the other
plainer and a good deal the worse for wear, both of a small size,
as if belonging to a young boy.</p>
<p>An oaken screen crossed the hall, close to the front door, and
there was a large open fireplace, a settle on each side under the
great yawning chimney, where however at present no fire was
burning.&nbsp; Before it was a long dining-table covered towards
the upper end with a delicately white cloth, on which stood,
however, a few trenchers, plain drinking-horns, and a large
old-fashioned black-jack, that is to say, a pitcher formed of
leather.&nbsp; An armchair was at the head of the table, and
heavy oaken benches along the side.</p>
<p>A little boy of six years old sat astride on the end of one of
the benches, round which he had thrown a bridle of plaited
rushes, and, with a switch in his other hand, was springing
himself up and down, calling out, &ldquo;Come, Eleanor, come,
Lucy; come and ride on a pillion behind me to Worcester, to see
King Charles and brother Edmund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come, I am coming!&rdquo; cried Eleanor, a
little girl about a year older, her hair put tightly away under a
plain round cap, and she was soon perched sideways behind her
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fie, Mistress Eleanor; why, you would not ride to
the wars?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was said by a woman of about four or
five-and-twenty, tall, thin and spare, with a high colour, sharp
black eyes, and a waist which the long stiff stays, laced in
front, had pinched in till it was not much bigger than a
wasp&rsquo;s, while her quilted green petticoat, standing out
full below it, showed a very trim pair of ankles encased in
scarlet stockings, and a pair of bony red arms came forth from
the full short sleeves of a sort of white jacket, gathered in at
the waist.&nbsp; She was clattering backwards and forwards,
removing the dinner things, and talking to the children as she
did so in a sharp shrill tone: &ldquo;Such a racket as you make,
to be sure, and how you can have the heart to do so I can&rsquo;t
guess, not I, considering what may be doing this very
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Walter says they will all come back again,
brother Edmund, and Diggory, and all,&rdquo; said little Eleanor,
&ldquo;and then we shall be merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucy, who, though two years older,
wore the same prim round cap and long frock as her little sister,
&ldquo;then we shall have Edmund here again.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t remember him at all, Eleanor and Charlie, for we have
not seen him these six years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Deborah, the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!
these be weary wars, what won&rsquo;t let a gentleman live at
home in peace, nor his poor servants, who have no call to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame, Deb!&rdquo; cried Lucy; &ldquo;are not you
the King&rsquo;s own subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Deborah maundered on, &ldquo;It is all very well for
gentlefolks, but now it had all got quiet again, &rsquo;tis
mortal hard it should be stirred up afresh, and a poor soul
marched off, he don&rsquo;t know where, to fight with he
don&rsquo;t know who, for he don&rsquo;t know what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to know what!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy, growing
very angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you, Deb, I only wish I was a
man!&nbsp; I would take the great two-handled sword, and fight in
the very front rank for our Church and our King!&nbsp; You would
soon see what a brave cavalier&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;son I
mean,&rdquo; said Lucy, getting into a puzzle, &ldquo;could
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more eager Lucy grew, the more unhappy Deborah was, and
putting her apron to her eyes, she said in a dismal voice,
&ldquo;Ah! &rsquo;tis little poor Diggory wots of kings and
cavaliers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Lucy&rsquo;s indignation would have led her to say next
can never be known, for at this moment in bounced a tall slim boy
of thirteen, his long curling locks streaming tangled behind
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;what is the
matter now?&nbsp; Dainty Deborah in the dumps?&nbsp; Cheer up, my
lass!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll warrant that doughty Diggory is discreet
enough to encounter no more bullets than he can reasonably
avoid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made Deborah throw down her apron and reply, with a toss
of the head, &ldquo;None of your nonsense, Master Walter, unless
you would have me speak to my lady.&nbsp; Cry for Diggory,
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was really crying for him, Walter,&rdquo;
interposed Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Lucy!&rdquo; exclaimed Deborah, angrily,
&ldquo;the life I lead among you is enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough to teach you good temper,&rdquo; said
Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want a little more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish someone was here to teach you good
manners,&rdquo; answered the tormented Deborah.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
if it was not enough for one poor girl to have the work of ten
servants on her hands, here must you be mock, mock, jeer, jeer,
worrit, worrit, all day long!&nbsp; I had rather be a mark for
all the musketeers in the Parliamentary army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Deborah always said when she was out of temper, and it
therefore made Walter and Lucy laugh the more; but in the midst
of their merriment in came a girl of sixteen or seventeen, tall
and graceful.&nbsp; Her head was bare, her hair fastened in a
knot behind, and in little curls round her face; she had an open
bodice of green silk, and a white dress under it, very plain and
neat; her step was quick and active, but her large dark eyes had
a grave thoughtful look, as if she was one who would naturally
have loved to sit still and think, better than to bustle about
and be busy.&nbsp; Eleanor ran up to her at once, complaining
that Walter was teasing Deborah shamefully.&nbsp; She was going
to speak, but Deborah cut her short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Mistress Rose, I will not have even you excuse him,
I&rsquo;ll go and tell my lady how a poor faithful wench is
served;&rdquo; and away she flounced, followed by Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she tell mamma?&rdquo; asked little Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Rose will pacify her,&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I wish she would tell,&rdquo; said Eleanor, a
much graver little person than Lucy; &ldquo;Walter is too
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only to save Diggory the trouble of taking a
crabstick to her when he returns from the wars,&rdquo; said
Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heigh ho!&rdquo; and he threw himself on the
bench, and drummed on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I was
there!&nbsp; I wonder what is doing at Worcester this
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will brother Edmund come?&rdquo; asked Charlie for
about the hundredth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the battle is fought, and the battle is won, and
King Charles enjoys his own again!&nbsp; Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted
Walter, jumping up, and beginning to sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For forty years our royal throne<br />
Has been his father&rsquo;s and his own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucy joined in with&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nor is there anyone but he<br />
With right can there a sharer be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How can you make such a noise?&rdquo; said Eleanor,
stopping her ears, by which she provoked Walter to go on roaring
into them, while he pulled down her hand&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For who better may<br />
The right sceptre sway<br />
Than he whose right it is to reign;<br />
Then look for no peace,<br />
For the war will never cease<br />
Till the King enjoys his own again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he came to the last line, Rose returning exclaimed,
&ldquo;Oh, hush, Lucy.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t, Walter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Rose turned Roundhead?&rdquo; cried
Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve to hear the good
news from Worcester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, what?&rdquo; cried the girls, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes,&rdquo; said Walter, delighted to have
taken in Rose herself; but Rose, going up to him gently, implored
him to be quiet, and listen to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this noisy rejoicing grieves our mother,&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you could but have seen her yesterday
evening, when she heard your loyal songs.&nbsp; She sighed, and
said, &lsquo;Poor fellow, how high his hopes are!&rsquo; and then
she talked of our father and that evening before the fight at
Naseby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter looked grave and said, &ldquo;I remember!&nbsp; My
father lifted me on the table to drink King Charles&rsquo;s
health, and Prince Rupert&mdash;I remember his scarlet mantle and
white plume&mdash;patted my head, and called me his little
cavalier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sat apart with mother,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;and
heard the loud cheers and songs till we were half frightened at
the noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t recollect all that,&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you ought not to forget how our dear father
came in with Edmund, and kissed us, and bade mother keep up a
good heart.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember that, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;it was the last time
we ever saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Walter sat on the table, resting one foot on the bench,
while the other dangled down, and leaning his elbow on his knee
and his head on his hand; Rose sat on the bench close by him,
with Charlie on her lap, and the two little girls pressing close
against her, all earnest to hear from her the story of the great
fight of Naseby, where they had all been in a farmhouse about a
mile from the field of battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t forget how the cannon roared all
day,&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that dismal day!&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then by came our troopers, blood-stained and disorderly,
riding so fast that scarcely one waited to tell my mother that
the day was lost and she had better fly.&nbsp; But not a step did
she stir from the gate, where she stood with you, Charlie, in her
arms; she only asked of each as he passed if he had seen my
father or Edmund, and ever her cheek grew whiter and
whiter.&nbsp; At last came a Parliament officer on
horseback&mdash;it was Mr. Enderby, who had been a college mate
of my father&rsquo;s, and he told us that my dear father was
wounded, and had sent him to fetch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never knew where Edmund was then,&rdquo; said
Eleanor.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one ever told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edmund lifted up my father when he fell,&rdquo; said
Walter, &ldquo;and was trying to bind his wound; but when Colonel
Enderby&rsquo;s troop was close upon them, my father charged him
upon his duty to fly, saying that he should fall into the hands
of an old friend, and it was Edmund&rsquo;s duty to save himself
to fight for the King another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Edmund followed Prince Rupert?&rdquo; said
Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucy; &ldquo;you know my father once
saved Prince Rupert&rsquo;s life in the skirmish where his horse
was killed, so for his sake the Prince made Edmund his page, and
has had him with him in all his voyages and wanderings.&nbsp; But
go on about our father, Rose.&nbsp; Did we go to see
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Mr. Enderby said he was too far off, so he left a
trooper to guard us, and my mother only took her little babe with
her.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember, Walter, how Eleanor screamed
after her, as she rode away on the colonel&rsquo;s horse; and how
we could not comfort the little ones, till they had cried
themselves to sleep, poor little things?&nbsp; And in the morning
she came back, and told us our dear father was dead!&nbsp; O
Walter, how can we look back to that day, and rejoice in a new
war?&nbsp; How can you wonder her heart should sink at sounds of
joy which have so often ended in tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter twisted about and muttered, but he could not resist his
sister&rsquo;s earnest face and tearful eyes, and said something
about not making so much noise in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my own dear brother,&rdquo; said
Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t tease Deborah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too much, Rose.&nbsp; It is all the sport I
have, to see the faces she makes when I plague her about
Diggory.&nbsp; Besides, it serves her right for having such a
temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has not a good temper, poor thing!&rdquo; said
Rose; &ldquo;but if you would only think how true and honest she
is, how hard she toils, and how ill she fares, and yet how
steadily she holds to us, you would surely not plague and torment
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose was interrupted by a great outcry, and in rushed Deborah,
screaming out, &ldquo;Lack-a-day!&nbsp; Mistress Rose!&nbsp; O
Master Walter! what will become of us?&nbsp; The fight is lost,
the King fled, and a whole regiment of red-coats burning and
plundering the whole country.&nbsp; Our throats will be cut,
every one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a chance of being a mark for all the
musketeers in the Parliament army,&rdquo; said Walter, who even
then could not miss a piece of mischief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joking now, Master Walter!&rdquo; cried Deborah, very
much shocked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is what I call downright
sinful.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll be made a mark of yourself,
that I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were running off to tell their mother, when Rose
stopped them, and desired to know how Deborah had heard the
tidings.&nbsp; It was from two little children from the village
who had come to bring a present of some pigeons to my lady.&nbsp;
Rose went herself to examine the children, but she could only
learn that a packman had come into the village and brought the
report that the King had been defeated, and had fled from the
field.&nbsp; They knew no more, and Walter pronouncing it to be
all a cock-and-bull story of some rascally prick-eared pedlar,
declared he would go down to the village and enquire into the
rights of it.</p>
<p>These were the saddest times of English history, when the
wrong cause had been permitted for a time to triumph, and the
true and rightful side was persecuted; and among those who
endured affliction for the sake of their Church and their King,
none suffered more, or more patiently, than Lady Woodley, or, as
she was called in the old English fashion, Dame Mary Woodley, of
Forest Lea.</p>
<p>When first the war broke out she was living happily in her
pleasant home with her husband and children; but when King
Charles raised his standard at Nottingham, all this comfort and
happiness had to be given up.&nbsp; Sir Walter Woodley joined the
royal army, and it soon became unsafe for his wife and children
to remain at home, so that they were forced to go about with him,
and suffer all the hardships of the sieges and battles.&nbsp;
Lady Woodley was never strong, and her health was very much hurt
by all she went through; she was almost always unwell, and if
Rose, though then quite a child, had not shown care and sense
beyond her years for the little ones, it would be hard to say
what would have become of them.</p>
<p>Yet all she endured while dragging about her little babies
through the country, with bad or insufficient food, uncomfortable
lodgings, pain, weariness and anxiety, would have been as nothing
but for the heavy sorrows that came upon her also.&nbsp; First
she lost her only brother, Edmund Mowbray, and in the battle of
Naseby her husband was killed; besides which there were the
sorrows of the whole nation in seeing the King sold, insulted,
misused, and finally slain, by his own subjects.&nbsp; After Sir
Walter&rsquo;s death, Lady Woodley went home with her five
younger children to her father&rsquo;s house at Forest Lea; for
her husband&rsquo;s estate, Edmund&rsquo;s own inheritance, had
been seized and sequestrated by the rebels.&nbsp; She was the
heiress of Forest Lea since the loss of her brother, but the old
Mr. Mowbray, her father, had given almost all his wealth for the
royal cause, and had been oppressed by the exactions of the
rebels, so that he had nothing to leave his daughter but the
desolate old house and a few bare acres of land.&nbsp; For the
shelter, however, Lady Woodley was very thankful; and there she
lived with her children and a faithful servant, Deborah, whose
family had always served the Mowbrays, and who would not desert
their daughter now.</p>
<p>The neighbours in the village loved, and were sorry for, their
lady, and used to send her little presents; there was a large
garden in which Diggory Stokes, who had also served her father,
raised vegetables for her use; the cow wandered in the deserted
park, and so they contrived to find food; while all the work of
the house was done by Rose and Deborah.&nbsp; Rose was her
mother&rsquo;s great comfort, nursing her, cheering her, taking
care of the little ones, teaching them, working for them, and
making light of all her exertions.&nbsp; Everyone in the village
loved Rose Woodley, for everyone had in some way been helped or
cheered by her.&nbsp; Her mother was only sometimes afraid she
worked too hard, and would try her strength too much; but she was
always bright and cheerful, and when the day&rsquo;s work was
done no one was more gay and lively and ready for play with the
little ones.</p>
<p>Rose had more trial than anyone knew with Deborah.&nbsp;
Deborah was as faithful as possible, and bore a great deal for
the sake of her mistress, worked hard day and night, had little
to eat and no wages, yet lived on with them rather than forsake
her dear lady and the children.&nbsp; One thing, however, Deborah
would not do, and that was to learn to rule her tongue and her
temper.&nbsp; She did not know, nor do many excellent servants,
how much trial and discomfort she gave to those she loved so
earnestly, by her constant bursting out into hasty words whenever
she was vexed&mdash;her grumbling about whatever she disliked,
and her ill-judged scolding of the children.&nbsp; Servants in
those days were allowed to speak more freely to their masters and
mistresses than at present, so that Deborah had more opportunity
of making such speeches, and it was Rose&rsquo;s continual work
to try to keep her temper from being fretted, or Lady Woodley
from being teased with her complaints.&nbsp; Rose was very
forbearing, and but for this there would have been little peace
in the house.</p>
<p>Walter was thirteen, an age when it is not easy to keep boys
in order, unless they will do so for themselves.&nbsp; Though a
brave generous boy, he was often unruly and inconsiderate, apt
not to obey, and to do what he knew to be unkind or wrong, just
for the sake of present amusement.&nbsp; He was thus his
mother&rsquo;s great anxiety, for she knew that she was not fit
either to teach or to restrain him, and she feared that his
present wild disobedient ways might hurt his character for ever,
and lead to dispositions which would in time swallow up all the
good about him, and make him what he would now tremble to think
of.</p>
<p>She used to talk of her anxieties to Doctor Bathurst, the good
old clergyman who had been driven away from his parish, but used
to come in secret to help, teach, and use his ministry for the
faithful ones of his flock.&nbsp; He would tell her that while
she did her best for her son, she must trust the rest to his
<span class="smcap">Father</span> above, and she might do so
hopefully, since it had been in His own cause that the boy had
been made fatherless.&nbsp; Then he would speak to Walter,
showing him how wrong and how cruel were his overbearing,
disobedient ways.&nbsp; Walter was grieved, and resolved to
improve and become steadier, that he might be a comfort and
blessing to his mother; but in his love of fun and mischief he
was apt to forget himself, and then drove away what might have
been in time repentance and improvement, by fancying he did no
harm.&nbsp; Teasing Deborah served her right, he would tell
himself, she was so ill-tempered and foolish; Diggory was a clod,
and would do nothing without scolding; it was a good joke to
tease Charlie; Eleanor was a vexatious little thing, and he would
not be ordered by her; so he went his own way, and taught the
merry chattering Lucy to be very nearly as bad as himself,
neglected his duties, set a bad example, tormented a faithful
servant, and seriously distressed his mother.&nbsp; Give him some
great cause, he thought, and he would be the first and the best,
bring back the King, protect his mother and sisters, and perform
glorious deeds, such as would make his name be remembered for
ever.&nbsp; Then it would be seen what he was worth; in the
meantime he lived a dull life, with nothing to do, and he must
have some fun.&nbsp; It did not signify if he was not particular
about little things, they were women&rsquo;s affairs, and all
very well for Rose, but when some really important matter came,
that would be his time for distinguishing himself.</p>
<p>In the meantime Charles II. had been invited to Scotland, and
had brought with him, as an attendant, Edmund Woodley, the eldest
son.&nbsp; As soon as he was known to have entered England, some
of the loyal gentlemen of the neighbourhood of Forest Lea went to
join the King, and among their followers went Farmer Ewins, who
had fought bravely in the former war under Edmund Mowbray,
several other of the men of the village, and lastly, Diggory
Stokes, Lady Woodley&rsquo;s serving man, who had lately shown
symptoms of discontent with his place, and fancied that as a
soldier he might fare better, make his fortune, and come home
prosperously to marry his sweetheart, Deborah.</p>
<h2><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Walter</span> ran down to the village at
full speed.&nbsp; He first bent his steps towards the
&ldquo;Half-Moon,&rdquo; the little public-house, where news was
sure to be met with.&nbsp; As he came towards it, however, he
heard the loud sound of a man&rsquo;s voice going steadily on as
if with some discourse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some preachment,&rdquo; said
he to himself: &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got a thorough-going
Roundhead, I can hear his twang through his nose!&nbsp; Shall I
go in or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was asking himself this question, an old peasant in a
round frock came towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo, Will!&rdquo; shouted Walter, &ldquo;what
prick-eared rogue have you got there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, Master Walter!&rdquo; said the old man,
taking off his hat very respectfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Best take care
what you say, there be plenty of red-coats about.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s one of them now preaching away in marvellous pied
words.&nbsp; It is downright shocking to hear the Bible hollaed
out after that sort, so I came away.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you go
nigh him, sir, &rsquo;specially with your hat set on in
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind my hat,&rdquo; said Walter, impatiently,
&ldquo;it is no business of yours, and I&rsquo;ll wear it as I
please in spite of old Noll and all his crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For his forefathers&rsquo; sake, and for the love of his
mother and sister, the good village people bore with
Walter&rsquo;s haughtiness and discourtesy far more than was good
for him, and the old man did not show how much he was hurt by his
rough reception of his good advice.&nbsp; Walter was not reminded
that he ought to rise up before the hoary head, and reverence the
old man, and went on hastily, &ldquo;But tell me, Will, what do
you hear of the battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle, sir! why, they say it is lost.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what the fellow there is preaching about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where was it?&nbsp; Did you hear?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so hasty, don&rsquo;t ye, sir!&rdquo;
said the old slow-spoken man, growing confused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where was it?&nbsp; At some town&mdash;some town, they
said, but I don&rsquo;t know rightly the name of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the King?&nbsp; Who was it?&nbsp; Not
Cromwell?&nbsp; Had Lord Derby joined?&rdquo; cried Walter,
hurrying on his questions so as to puzzle and confuse the old man
more and more, till at last he grew angry at getting no
explanation, and vowed it was no use to talk to such an old
fool.&nbsp; At that moment a sound as of feet and horses came
along the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the soldiers!&rdquo; said
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, best get out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter thought so too, and, springing over a hedge, ran off
into a neighbouring wood, resolving to take a turn, and come back
by the longer way to the house, so as to avoid the road.&nbsp; He
walked across the wood, looking up at the ripening nuts, and now
and then springing up to reach one, telling himself all the time
that it was untrue, and that the King could not, and should not
be defeated.&nbsp; The wood grew less thick after a time, and
ended in low brushwood, upon an open common.&nbsp; Just as Walter
was coming to this place, he saw an unusual sight: a man and a
horse crossing the down.&nbsp; Slowly and wearily they came, the
horse drooping its head and stumbling in its pace, as though worn
out with fatigue, but he saw that it was a war-horse, and the
saddle and other equipments were such as he well remembered in
the royal army long ago.&nbsp; The rider wore buff coat, cuirass,
gauntlets guarded with steel, sword, and pistols, and
Walter&rsquo;s first impulse was to avoid him; but on giving a
second glance, he changed his mind, for though there was neither
scarf, plume, nor any badge of party, the long locks, the set of
the hat, and the general air of the soldier were not those of a
rebel.&nbsp; He must be a cavalier, but, alas! far unlike the
triumphant cavaliers whom Walter had hoped to receive, for he was
covered with dust and blood, as if he had fought and ridden
hard.&nbsp; Walter sprung forward to meet him, and saw that he
was a young man, with dark eyes and hair, looking very pale and
exhausted, and both he and his horse seemed hardly able to stir a
step further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;what place
is this?&nbsp; Am I near Forest Lea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flash of joy crossed Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Edmund! are you
Edmund?&rdquo; he exclaimed, colouring deeply, and looking up in
his face with one quick glance, then casting down his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are little Walter,&rdquo; returned the
cavalier, instantly dismounting, and flinging his arm around his
brother; &ldquo;why, what a fine fellow you are grown!&nbsp; How
are my mother and all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, quite well!&rdquo; cried Walter, in a transport
of joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! how happy she will be!&nbsp; Come, make
haste home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I dare not as yet.&nbsp; I must not enter
the house till nightfall, or I should bring danger on you
all.&nbsp; Are there any troopers near?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the village is full of the rascals.&nbsp; But what
has happened?&nbsp; It is not true that&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He
could not bear to say the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too true!&rdquo; said Edmund, leading his tired horse
within the shelter of the bushes.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all over
with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle lost!&rdquo; said Walter, in a stifled tone;
and in all the bitterness of the first disappointment of his
youth, he turned away, overcome by a gush of tears and sobs,
stamping as he walked up and down, partly with the intensity of
his grief, partly with shame at being seen by his brother, in
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you set your heart on it so much?&rdquo; said
Edmund, kindly, pleased to see his young brother so ardent a
loyalist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor fellow!&nbsp; But at least the King
was safe when I parted from him.&nbsp; Come, cheer up, Walter,
the right will be uppermost some day or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oh, that battle!&nbsp; I had so longed to see old
Noll get his deserts,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;I made so
sure.&nbsp; But how did it happen, Edmund?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you all now, Walter.&nbsp; You must find
me some covert where I can be till night fall.&nbsp; The rebels
are hot in pursuit of all the fugitives.&nbsp; I have ridden from
Worcester by byroads day and night, and I am fairly spent.&nbsp;
I must be off to France or Holland as soon as may be, for my life
is not safe a moment here.&nbsp; Cromwell is bitterer than ever
against all honest men, but I could not help coming this way, I
so much longed to see my mother and all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not wounded?&rdquo; said Walter, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to speak of, only a sword-cut on my shoulder,
by which I have lost more blood than convenient for such a
journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll lead your horse; lean on me,&rdquo;
said Walter, alarmed at the faint, weary voice in which his
brother spoke after the first excitement of the
recognition.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you what Lucy and I
call our bower, where no one ever comes but ourselves.&nbsp;
There you can rest till night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And poor Bayard?&rdquo; said Edmund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could put him into the out-house in the field
next to the copse, hide his trappings here, and get him provender
from Ewins&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; Will that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellently.&nbsp; Poor Ewins!&mdash;that is a sad
story.&nbsp; He fell, fighting bravely by my side, cut down in
Sidbury Street in the last charge.&nbsp; Alas! these are evil
days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Diggory Stokes, our own knave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of him after the first onset.&nbsp;
Rogues and cowards enough were there.&nbsp; Think, Walter, of
seeing his Majesty strive in vain to rally them, when the day
might yet have been saved, and the traitors hung down their
heads, and stood like blocks while he called on them rather to
shoot him dead than let him live to see such a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, had I but been there, to turn them all to
shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were a few, Walter; Lord Cleveland, Hamilton,
Careless, Giffard, and a few more of us, charged down Sidbury
Street, and broke into the ranks of the rebels, while the King
had time to make off by S. Martin&rsquo;s Gate.&nbsp; Oh, how I
longed for a few more!&nbsp; But the King was saved so far;
Careless, Giffard, and I came up with him again, and we parted at
nightfall.&nbsp; Lord Derby&rsquo;s counsel was that he should
seek shelter at Boscobel, and he was to disguise himself, and go
thither under Giffard&rsquo;s guidance.&nbsp; Heaven guard him,
whatever becomes of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Walter, earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
here we are.&nbsp; Here is Lucy&rsquo;s bank of turf, and my
throne, and here we will wait till the sun is down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a beautiful green slope, covered with soft grass, short
thyme, and cushion-like moss, and overshadowed by a thick, dark
yew-tree, shut in by brushwood on all sides, and forming just
such a retreat as children love to call their own.&nbsp; Edmund
threw himself down at full length on it, laid aside his hat, and
passed his hand across his weary forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
quiet!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but, hark! is that the bubbling of
water?&rdquo; he added, raising himself eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here,&rdquo; said Walter, showing him where, a
little further off on the same slope, a little clear spring rose
in a natural basin of red earth, fringed along the top with fresh
green mosses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delicious!&rdquo; said the tired soldier, kneeling over
the spring, scooping it up in his hand to drink, opening his
collar, and bathing hands and face in the clear cool fountain,
till his long black hair hung straight, saturated with wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Bayard, it is your turn,&rdquo; and he patted the
good steed as it sucked up the refreshing water, and Walter
proceeded to release it from saddle and bridle.&nbsp; Edmund,
meanwhile, stretched himself out on the mossy bank, asked a few
questions about his mother, Rose, and the other children, but was
too tired to say much, and presently fell sound asleep, while
Walter sat by watching him, grieving for the battle lost, but
proud and important in being the guardian of his brother&rsquo;s
safety, and delighting himself with the thought of bringing him
home at night.</p>
<p>More was happening at home than Walter guessed.&nbsp; The time
of his absence seemed very long, more especially when the
twilight began to close in, and Lady Woodley began to fear that
he might, with his rashness, have involved himself in some
quarrel with the troopers in the village.&nbsp; Lady Woodley and
her children had closed around the wood fire which had been
lighted on the hearth at the approach of evening, and Rose was
trying by the bad light to continue her darning of stockings,
when a loud hasty knocking was heard at the door, and all, in a
general vague impression of dread, started and drew together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my lady!&rdquo; cried Deborah, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
bid me go to the door, I could not if you offered me fifty gold
caroluses!&nbsp; I had rather stand up to be a
mark&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will,&rdquo; said Rose, advancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Mistress Rose,&rdquo; said Deborah, running
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know what is fit for the like
of you?&nbsp; You go opening the door to rogues and vagabonds,
indeed!&rdquo; and with these words she undrew the bolts and
opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the way you keep us waiting?&rdquo; said an
impatient voice; and a tall youth, handsomely accoutred, advanced
authoritatively into the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prepare
to&mdash;&rdquo; but as he saw himself alone with women and
children, and his eyes fell on the pale face, mourning dress, and
graceful air of the lady of the house, he changed his tone,
removed his hat, and said, &ldquo;Your pardon, madam, I came to
ask a night&rsquo;s lodging for my father, who has been thrown
from his horse, and badly bruised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot refuse you, sir,&rdquo; said Lady Woodley, who
instantly perceived that this was an officer of the Parliamentary
force, and was only thankful to see that he was a gentleman, and
enforced with courtesy a request which was in effect a
command.</p>
<p>The youth turned and went out, while Lady Woodley hastily
directed her daughters and servant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Deborah, set the
blue chamber in order; Rose, take the key of the oak press,
Eleanor will help you to take out the holland sheets.&nbsp; Lucy,
run down to old Margery, and bid her kill a couple of fowls for
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls obeyed there entered at the front door the young
officer and a soldier, supporting between them an elderly man in
the dress of an officer of rank.&nbsp; Lady Woodley, ready of
course to give her help to any person who had suffered an injury,
came forward to set a chair, and at the same moment she
exclaimed, in a tone of recognition, &ldquo;Mr. Enderby!&nbsp; I
am grieved to see you so much hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lady Woodley,&rdquo; he returned, recognising her at
the same time, as he seated himself in the chair, &ldquo;I am
sorry thus to have broken in on your ladyship, but my son,
Sylvester, would have me halt here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman is your son, then?&rdquo; and a
courteous greeting passed between Lady Woodley and young
Sylvester Enderby, after which she again enquired after his
father&rsquo;s accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No great matter,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;a blow on
the head, and a twist of the knee, that is all.&nbsp; Thanks to a
stumbling horse, wearied out with work, I have little mind
to&mdash;the pursuit of this poor young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the King?&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Woodley, breathless
with alarm.</p>
<p>It was with no apparent satisfaction that the rebel colonel
replied, &ldquo;Even so, madam.&nbsp; Cromwell&rsquo;s fortune
has not forsaken him; he has driven the Scots and their allies
out of Worcester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Woodley was too much accustomed to evil tidings to be as
much overcome by them as her young son had been; she only turned
somewhat paler, and asked, &ldquo;The King lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was last seen on Worcester bridge.&nbsp; Troops are
sent to every port whence he might attempt an escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the <span class="smcap">God</span> of his father
protect him,&rdquo; said the lady, fervently.&nbsp; &ldquo;And my
son?&rdquo; she added, faintly, scarcely daring to ask the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe, I hope,&rdquo; replied the colonel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I saw him, and I could have thought him my dear old friend
himself, as he joined Charles in his last desperate attempt to
rally his forces, and then charged down Sidbury Street with a few
bold spirits who were resolved to cover their master&rsquo;s
retreat.&nbsp; He is not among the slain; he was not a prisoner
when I left the headquarters.&nbsp; I trust he may have escaped,
for Cromwell is fearfully incensed against your party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Enderby was interrupted by Lucy&rsquo;s running in
calling out, &ldquo;Mother, mother! there are no fowls but
Partlet and the sitting hen, and the old cock, and I won&rsquo;t
have my dear old Partlet killed to be eaten by wicked
Roundheads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, my little lady,&rdquo; said the colonel,
holding out his hand, amused by her vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t speak to a Roundhead,&rdquo; returned
Lucy, with a droll air of petulance, pleased at being
courted.</p>
<p>Her mother spoke gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You forget yourself,
Lucy.&nbsp; This is Mr. Enderby, a friend of your dear
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy&rsquo;s cheeks glowed, and she looked down as she gave
her hand to the colonel; but as he spoke kindly to her, her
forward spirit revived, and she returned to the charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have Partlet killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother would have silenced her, but the colonel smiled and
said, &ldquo;No, no, little lady; I would rather go without
supper than let one feather of Dame Partlet be
touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, you need not do that either, sir,&rdquo; said the
little chatter-box, confidentially, &ldquo;for we are to have a
pie made of little Jenny&rsquo;s pigeons; and I&rsquo;ll tell you
what, sir, no one makes raised crust half so well as sister
Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Woodley was not sorry to stop the current of her little
girl&rsquo;s communications by despatching her on another
message, and asking Colonel Enderby whether he would not prefer
taking a little rest in his room before supper-time, offering, at
the same time all the remedies for bruises and wounds that every
good housekeeper of the time was sure to possess.</p>
<p>She had a real regard for Mr. Enderby, who had been a great
friend of her husband before the unhappy divisions of the period
arrayed them on opposite sides, and even then, though true
friendship could not last, a kindly feeling had always
existed.</p>
<p>Mr. Enderby was a conscientious man, but those were difficult
times; and he had regarded loyalty to the King less than what he
considered the rights of the people.&nbsp; He had been an admirer
of Hampden and his principles, and had taken up arms on the same
side, becoming a rebel on political, not on religious,
grounds.&nbsp; When, as time went on, the evils of the rebellion
developed themselves more fully, he was already high in command,
and so involved with his own party that he had not the resolution
requisite for a change of course and renunciation of his
associates.&nbsp; He would willingly have come to terms with the
King, and was earnest in the attempt at the time of the
conferences at Hampden Court.&nbsp; He strongly disapproved of
the usurpation of power by the army, and was struck with horror,
grief, and dismay, at the execution of King Charles; but still he
would not, or fancied that he could not, separate himself from
the cause of the Parliament, and continued in their service,
following Cromwell to Scotland, and fighting at Worcester on the
rebel side, disliking Cromwell all the time, and with a certain
inclination to the young King, and desire to see the old
constitution restored.</p>
<p>He was just one of those men who cause such great evil by
giving a sort of respectability to the wrong cause,
&ldquo;following a multitude to do evil,&rdquo; and doubtless
bringing a fearful responsibility on their own heads; yet with
many good qualities and excellent principles, that make those on
the right side have a certain esteem for them, and grieve to see
them thus perverted.</p>
<p>Lady Woodley, who knew him well, though sorry to have a rebel
in her house at such a time, was sure that in him she had a kind
and considerate guest, who would do his utmost to protect her and
her children.</p>
<p>On his side, Colonel Enderby was much grieved and shocked at
the pale, altered looks of the fair young bride he remembered, as
well as the evidences of poverty throughout her house, and
perhaps he had a secret wish that he was as well assured as his
friend, Sir Walter, that his blood had been shed for the
maintenance of the right.</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose Woodley</span> ran up and down
indefatigably, preparing everything for the accommodation of the
guests, smoothing down Deborah&rsquo;s petulance, and keeping her
mother from over-exertion or anxiety.&nbsp; Much contrivance was
indeed required, for besides the colonel and his son, two
soldiers had to be lodged, and four horses, which, to the
consternation of old Margery, seemed likely to devour the
cow&rsquo;s winter store of hay, while the troopers grumbled at
the desolate, half-ruined, empty stables, and at the want of
corn.</p>
<p>Rose had to look to everything; to provide blankets from the
bed of the two little girls, send Eleanor to sleep with her
mother, and take Lucy to her own room; despatch them on messages
to the nearest cottage to borrow some eggs, and to gather
vegetables in the garden, whilst she herself made the pigeon pie
with the standing crust, much wishing that the soldiers were out
of the way.&nbsp; It was a pretty thing to see her in her white
apron, with her neat dexterous fingers, and nimble quiet step,
doing everything in so short a time, and so well, without the
least bustle.</p>
<p>She was at length in the hall, laying the white home-spun,
home-bleached cloth, and setting the trenchers (all the Mowbray
plate had long ago gone in the King&rsquo;s service), wondering
anxiously, meantime, what could have become of Walter, with many
secret and painful misgivings, though she had been striving to
persuade her mother that he was only absent on some freak of his
own.</p>
<p>Presently the door which led to the garden was opened, and to
her great joy Walter put his head into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Walter,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;the battle is
lost! but Edmund and the King have both escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say you so?&rdquo; said Walter, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here is a gentleman who can give you some news of
Edmund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same moment Rose saw her beloved eldest brother enter
the room.&nbsp; It would be hard to say which was her first
thought, joy or dismay&mdash;she had no time to ask
herself.&nbsp; Quick as lightning she darted to the door leading
to the staircase, bolted it, threw the bar across the fastening
of the front entrance, and then, flying to her brother, clung
fast round his neck, kissed him on each cheek, and felt his
ardent kiss on her brow, as she exclaimed in a frightened
whisper, &ldquo;You must not stay here: there are troopers in the
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troopers!&mdash;quartered on us?&rdquo; cried
Walter.</p>
<p>Rose hastily explained, trembling lest anyone should attempt
to enter.&nbsp; Walter paced up and down in despair, vowing that
it was a trick to get a spy into the house.&nbsp; Edmund sat down
in the large arm-chair with a calm resolute look, saying,
&ldquo;I must surrender, then.&nbsp; Neither I nor my horse can
go further without rest.&nbsp; I will yield as a prisoner of war,
and well that it is to a man of honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no!&rdquo; cried Rose: &ldquo;he says Cromwell
treats his prisoners as rebels.&nbsp; It would be certain
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news of the King?&rdquo; asked Edmund,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not seen since the flight? but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lord Derby, Wilmot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell, I heard no names,&rdquo; said Rose,
&ldquo;only that the enemy&rsquo;s cruelties are worse than
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter stood with his back against the table, gazing at his
brother and sister in mute consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; cried Rose, suddenly: &ldquo;the
out-house in the upper field.&nbsp; No one ever goes up into the
loft but ourselves.&nbsp; You know, Walter, where Eleanor found
the kittens.&nbsp; Go thither, I will bring Edmund food at
night.&nbsp; Oh, consent, Edmund!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do! it will do!&rdquo; cried Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, it may spare my mother,&rdquo; said Edmund;
and as footsteps and voices were heard on the stairs, the two
brothers hurried off without another word, while Rose, trying to
conceal her agitation, undid the door, and admitted her two
little sisters, who were asking if they had not heard
Walter&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>She scarcely attended to them, but, bounding upstairs to her
mother&rsquo;s room, flung her arms round her neck, and poured
into her ear her precious secret.&nbsp; The tremour, the joy, the
fears, the tears, the throbbings of the heart, and earnest
prayers, may well be imagined, crowded by the mother and daughter
into those few minutes.&nbsp; The plan was quickly
arranged.&nbsp; They feared to trust even Deborah; so that the
only way that they could provide the food that Edmund so much
needed was by Rose and Walter attempting to save all they could
at supper, and Rose could steal out when everyone was gone to
rest, and carry it to him.&nbsp; Lady Woodley was bent on herself
going to her son that night; but Rose prevailed on her to lay
aside the intention, as it would have been fatal, in her weak
state of health, for her to expose herself to the chills of an
autumn night, and, what was with her a much more conclusive
reason, Rose was much more likely to be able to slip out
unobserved.&nbsp; Rose had an opportunity of explaining all this
to Walter, and imploring him to be cautious, before the colonel
and his son came down, and the whole party assembled round the
supper-table.</p>
<p>Lady Woodley had the eggs and bacon before her; Walter
insisted on undertaking the carving of the pigeon-pie, and looked
considerably affronted when young Sylvester Enderby offered to
take the office, as a more experienced carver.&nbsp; Poor Rose,
how her heart beat at every word and look, and how hard she
strove to seem perfectly at her ease and unconscious!&nbsp;
Walter was in a fume of anxiety and vexation, and could hardly
control himself so far as to speak civilly to either of the
guests, so that he was no less a cause of fear to his mother and
sister than the children, who were unconscious how much depended
on discretion.</p>
<p>Young Sylvester Enderby was a fine young man of eighteen, very
good-natured, and not at all like a Puritan in appearance or
manner.&nbsp; He had hardly yet begun to think for himself, and
was merely obeying his father in joining the army with him,
without questioning whether it was the right cause or not.&nbsp;
He was a kind elder brother at home, and here he was ready to be
pleased with the children of the house.</p>
<p>Lucy was a high-spirited talkative child, very little used to
seeing strangers, and perhaps hardly reined in enough, for her
poor mother&rsquo;s weak health had interfered with strict
discipline; and as this evening Walter and Rose were both grave
and serious under their anxieties, Lucy was less restrained even
than usual.</p>
<p>She was a pretty creature, with bright blue eyes, and an arch
expression, all the droller under her prim round cap; and
Sylvester was a good deal amused with her pert bold little nods
and airs.&nbsp; He paid a good deal of attention to her, and she
in return grew more forward and chattering.&nbsp; It is what
little girls will sometimes do under the pleasure and excitement
of the notice of gentlemen, and it makes their friends very
uneasy, since the only excuse they can have is in being <i>very
little</i>, and it shows a most undesirable want of self-command
and love of attention.</p>
<p>In addition to this feeling, Lady Woodley dreaded every word
that was spoken, lest it should lead to suspicion, for though she
was sure Mr. Enderby would not willingly apprehend her son, yet
she could not tell what he might consider his duty to his
employers; besides, there were the two soldiers to observe and
report, and the discovery that Edmund was at hand might lead to
frightful consequences.&nbsp; She tried to converse composedly
with him on his family and the old neighbourhood where they had
both lived, often interrupting herself to send a look or word of
warning to the lower end of the table; but Lucy and Charles were
too wild to see or heed her, and grew more and more unrestrained,
till at last, to the dismay of her mother, brother, and sister,
Charles&rsquo; voice was heard so loud as to attract
everyone&rsquo;s notice, in a shout of wonder and complaint,
&ldquo;Mother, mother, look!&nbsp; Rose has gobbled up a whole
pigeon to her own share!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose could not keep herself from blushing violently, as she
whispered reprovingly that he must not be rude.&nbsp; Lucy did
not mend the matter by saying with an impertinent nod,
&ldquo;Rose does not like to be found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said Lady Woodley, gravely, &ldquo;I
shall send you away if you do not behave discreetly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mother, Rose is greedy,&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongues, little mischief makers!&rdquo; burst
out Walter, who had been boiling over with anxiety and
indignation the whole time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter is cross now,&rdquo; said Lucy, pleased to have
produced a sensation, and to have shocked Eleanor, who sat all
the time as good, demure, and grave, as if she had been forty
years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse these children,&rdquo; said Lady Woodley,
trying to hide her anxiety under cover of displeasure at them;
&ldquo;no doubt Mrs. Enderby keeps much better order at
home.&nbsp; Lucy, Charles, silence at once.&nbsp; Walter, is
there no wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is, it is too good for rebels,&rdquo; muttered
Walter to himself, as he rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Light me, Deborah,
and I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La!&nbsp; Master Walter,&rdquo; whispered Deborah,
&ldquo;you know there is nothing but the dregs of the old cask of
Malmsey, that was drunk up at the old squire&rsquo;s
burying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, Deb,&rdquo; returned the boy; &ldquo;fill
it up with water, and it will be quite good enough for those who
won&rsquo;t drink the King&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deborah gave a half-puzzled smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a
madcap, Master Walter!&nbsp; But sure, Sir, the spirit of a wolf
must have possessed Mistress Rose&mdash;she that eats no supper
at all, in general!&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye think it is wearying about
Master Edmund that gives her a craving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might be dangerous, but Walter was so much diverted, that
he could not help saying, &ldquo;I have no doubt it is on his
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Deborah, &ldquo;that I get so faint
at heart that I am forced to be taking something all day long to
keep about at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they were re-entering the hall, when there was a
sound from the kitchen as of someone calling.&nbsp; Deborah
instantly turned, screaming out joyfully, &ldquo;Bless me! is it
you?&rdquo; and though out of sight, her voice was still heard in
its high notes of joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You good-for-nothing rogue!
are you turned up again like a bad tester, staring into the
kitchen like a great oaf, as you be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh, and Eleanor said, &ldquo;That must
be Diggory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor country clown,&rdquo; said Lady Woodley,
&ldquo;whom we sent to join my son&rsquo;s troop.&nbsp; I hope he
is in no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Mr. Enderby; &ldquo;he has only to
return to his plough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo there!&rdquo; shouted Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
in, Diggory, and show yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In came Diggory, an awkward thick-set fellow, with a shock
head of hair, high leathern gaiters, and a buff belt over his
rough leathern jerkin.&nbsp; There he stood, pulling his
forelock, and looking sheepish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Diggory,&rdquo; said his mistress; &ldquo;I am
glad to see you safe.&nbsp; You need not be afraid of these
gentlemen.&nbsp; Where are the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slain, every man of them, an&rsquo;t please your
ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your master, Mr. Woodley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, too, an&rsquo;t please your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy screamed aloud; Eleanor ran to her mother, and hid her
face in her lap; Charles sat staring, with great round frightened
eyes.&nbsp; Very distressing it was to be obliged to leave the
poor children in such grief and alarm, when it was plain all the
time that Diggory was an arrant coward, who had fancied more
deaths and dangers than were real, and was describing more than
he had even thought he beheld, in order to make himself into a
hero instead of a runaway.&nbsp; Moreover, Lady Woodley and Rose
had to put on a show of grief, lest they should betray that they
were better informed; and they were in agonies lest
Walter&rsquo;s fury at the falsehoods should be as apparent to
their guests as it was to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of what you say, Diggory?&rdquo; said Lady
Woodley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure as that I stand here, my lady.&nbsp; There was
sword and shot and smoke all round.&nbsp; I stood it all till
Farmer Ewins was cut down a-one-side of me, ma&rsquo;am, and
Master Edmund, more&rsquo;s the pity, with his brains scattered
here and there on the banks of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another cry among the children, and Walter made such
a violent gesture, that Rose, covering her face with her
handkerchief, whispered to him, &ldquo;Walter dear, take
care.&rdquo;&nbsp; Walter relieved his mind by returning,
&ldquo;Oh that I could cudgel the rogue soundly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time Colonel Enderby turned to their mother,
saying, &ldquo;Take comfort, madam, this fellow&rsquo;s tale
carries discredit on the face of it.&nbsp; Let me examine him,
with your permission.&nbsp; Where did you last see your
master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know none of your places, sir,&rdquo; answered
Diggory, sullenly.</p>
<p>Colonel Enderby spoke sternly and peremptorily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the town, or in the fields?&nbsp; Answer me that,
sirrah.&nbsp; In the field on the bank of the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you left your ranks, you rogue; that was the way
you lost sight of your master!&rdquo; said the colonel.&nbsp;
Then, turning to Lady Woodley, as Diggory slunk off, &ldquo;Your
ladyship need not be alarmed.&nbsp; An hour after the encounter,
in which he pretends to have seen your son slain, I saw him in
full health and soundness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cowardly villain!&rdquo; cried Walter, delighted to
let out some of his indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew he was not
speaking a word of truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children cheered up in a moment; but Lady Woodley was not
sorry to make this agitating scene an excuse for retiring with
all her children.&nbsp; Lucy and Eleanor were quite comforted,
and convinced that Edmund must be safe; but poor little Charlie
had been so dreadfully frightened by the horrors of
Diggory&rsquo;s description, that after Rose had put him to bed
he kept on starting up in his sleep, half waking, and sobbing
about brother Edmund&rsquo;s brains.</p>
<p>Rose was obliged to go to him and soothe him.&nbsp; She longed
to assure the poor little fellow that dear Edmund was perfectly
safe, well, and near at hand; but the secret was too important to
be trusted to one so young, so she could only coax and comfort
him, and tell him they all thought it was not true, and Edmund
would come back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Charlie, &ldquo;may I say my
prayers again for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do, dear Charlie,&rdquo; said Rose; &ldquo;and say
a prayer for King Charles too, that he may be safe from the
wicked man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So little Charlie knelt by Rose, with his hands joined, and
his little bare legs folded together, and said his prayer: and
did not his sister&rsquo;s heart go with him?&nbsp; Then she
kissed him, covered him up warmly, and repeated to him in her
soft voice the ninety-first Psalm: &ldquo;Whoso dwelleth under
the defence of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the
Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time it was ended, the little boy was fast asleep, and
the faithful loyal girl felt her failing heart cheered and
strengthened for whatever might be before her, sure that she, her
mother, her brother, and her King, were under the shadow of the
Almighty wings.</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a very strong fit of
restlessness did little Mistress Lucy Woodley go to bed in
Rose&rsquo;s room that night.&nbsp; She was quite comforted on
Edmund&rsquo;s account, for she had discernment enough to see
that her mother and sister did not believe Diggory&rsquo;s
dreadful narration; and she had been so unsettled and excited by
Mr. Sylvester Enderby&rsquo;s notice, and by the way in which she
had allowed her high spirits to get the better of her discretion,
as well as by the sudden change from terror to joy, that when
first she went to Rose&rsquo;s room she could not attend to her
prayers, and next she could not go to sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps the being in a different apartment from usual, and the
missing her accustomed sleeping companion, Eleanor, had something
to do with it, for little Eleanor had a gravity and steadiness
about her that was very apt to compose and quiet her in her
idlest moods.&nbsp; To-night she lay broad awake, tumbling about
on the very hard mattress, stuffed with chaff, wondering how Rose
could bear to sleep on it, trying to guess how there could be
room for both when her sister came to bed, and nevertheless in a
great fidget for her to come.&nbsp; She listened to the howling
and moaning of the wind, the creaking of the doors, and the
rattling of the boards with which Rose had stopped up the broken
panes of her lattice; she rolled from side to side, fancied odd
shapes in the dark, and grew so restless and anxious for
Rose&rsquo;s coming that she was just ready to jump out of bed
and go in the passage to call her when Rose came into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Rose, what a time you have been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no satisfaction to Rose to find the curious little
chatter-box so wide awake at this very inconvenient time, but she
did not lose her patience, and answered that she had been first
with Charlie, and then with their mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I hope you are coming to bed.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t go to sleep without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but indeed you must, Lucy dear, for I shall not be
ready this long time.&nbsp; Look, here is a great rent in
Walter&rsquo;s coat, which I must mend, or he won&rsquo;t be fit
to be seen to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we have for dinner to-morrow, Rose?&nbsp;
What made you eat so much supper to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Lucy, I am not going to talk
to you, or you will lie awake all night, and that will be very
bad for you.&nbsp; I shall put my candle out of your sight, and
say some Psalms, but I cannot talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Rose began, and, wakeful as Lucy was, she found the low
sweet tones lulled her a little.&nbsp; But she did not like this;
she had a perverse intention of staying awake till Rose got into
bed, so instead of attending to the holy words, she pinched
herself, and pulled herself, and kept her eyes staring open,
gazing at the flickering shadows cast by the dim home-made rush
candle.</p>
<p>She went to sleep for a moment, then started into wakefulness
again; Rose had ceased to repeat her Psalms aloud, but was still
at her needlework; another doze, another waking.&nbsp; There was
some hope of Rose now, for she was kneeling down to say her
prayers.&nbsp; Lucy thought they lasted very long, and at her
next waking she was just in time to hear the latch of the door
closing, and find herself left in darkness.&nbsp; Rose was not in
bed, did not answer when she called.&nbsp; Oh, she must be gone
to take Walter&rsquo;s coat back to his room.&nbsp; But surely
she might have done that in one moment; and how long she was
staying!&nbsp; Lucy could bear it no longer, or rather she did
not try to bear it, for she was an impetuous, self-willed child,
without much control over herself.&nbsp; She jumped out of bed,
and stole to the door.&nbsp; A light was just disappearing on the
ceiling, as if someone was carrying a candle down stairs; what
could it mean?&nbsp; Lucy scampered, pit-pat, with her bare feet
along the passage, and came to the top of the stairs in time to
peep over and discover Rose silently opening the door of the
hall, a large dark cloak hung over her arm, and her head and neck
covered by her black silk hood and a thick woollen kerchief, as
if she was going out.</p>
<p>Lucy&rsquo;s curiosity knew no bounds.&nbsp; She would not
call, for fear she should be sent back to bed, but she was
determined to see what her sister could possibly be about.&nbsp;
Down the cold stone steps pattered she, and luckily, as she
thought, Rose, probably to avoid noise, had only shut to the
door, so that the little inquisitive maiden had a chink to peep
through, and beheld Rose at a certain oaken corner-cupboard,
whence she took out a napkin, and in it she folded what Lucy
recognised as the very same three-cornered segment of pie-crust,
containing the pigeon that she had last night been accused of
devouring.&nbsp; She placed it in a basket, and then proceeded to
take a lantern from the cupboard, put in her rushlight, and, thus
prepared, advanced to the garden-door, softly opened it, and
disappeared.</p>
<p>Lucy, in an extremity of amazement, came forward.&nbsp; The
wind howled in moaning gusts, and the rain dashed against the
windows; Lucy was chilly and frightened.&nbsp; The fire was not
out, and gave a dim light, and she crept towards the window, but
a sudden terror came over her; she dashed back, looked again,
heard another gust of wind, fell into another panic, rushed back
to the stairs, and never stopped till she had tumbled into bed,
her teeth chattering, shivering from head to foot with fright and
cold, rolled herself up tight in the bed-clothes, and, after
suffering excessively from terror and chill, fell sound asleep
without seeing her sister return.</p>
<p>Causeless fears pursue those who are not in the right path,
and turn from what alone can give them confidence.&nbsp; A sense
of protection supports those who walk in innocence, though their
way may seem surrounded with perils; and thus, while Lucy
trembled in an agony of fright in her warm bed, Rose walked forth
with a firm and fearless step through the dark gusty night,
heedless of the rain that pattered round her, and the wild wind
that snatched at her cloak and gown, and flapped her hood into
her eyes.</p>
<p>She was not afraid of fancied terrors, and real perils and
anxieties were at this moment lost in the bounding of her young
heart at the thought of seeing, touching, speaking to her
brother, her dear Edmund.&nbsp; She had been eleven years old
when they last had parted, the morning of the battle of Naseby,
and he was five years older; but they had always been very happy
and fond companions and playfellows as long as she could
remember, and she alone had been on anything like an equality
with him, or missed him with a feeling of personal loss, that had
been increased by the death of her elder sister, Mary.</p>
<p>Quickly, and concealing her light as much as possible, she
walked down the damp ash-strewn paths of the kitchen-garden, and
came out into the overgrown and neglected shrubbery, or
pleasance, where the long wet-laden shoots came beating in her
face, and now and then seeming to hold her back, and strange
rustlings were heard that would have frightened a maiden of a
less stout and earnest heart.&nbsp; Her anxiety was lest she
should be confused by the unwonted aspect of things in the dark,
and miss the path; and very, very long did it seem, while her
light would only show her leaves glistening with wet.&nbsp; At
last she gained a clearer space, the border of a field: something
dark rose before her, she knew the outline of the shed, and
entered the lower part.&nbsp; It was meant for a cart-shed, with
a loft above for hay or straw; but the cart had been lost or
broken, and there was only a heap of rubbish in the corner, by
which the children were wont to climb up to inspect their
kittens.&nbsp; Here Rose was for a moment startled by a glare
close to her of what looked like two fiery lamps in the darkness,
but the next instant a long, low, growling sound explained it,
and the tabby stripes of the cat quickly darted across her
lantern&rsquo;s range of light.&nbsp; She heard a slight rustling
above, and ventured to call, in a low whisper,
&ldquo;Edmund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Walter?&rdquo; and as Rose proceeded to
mount the pile of rubbish, his pale and haggard face looked down
at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; Rose herself!&nbsp; I did not think you
would have come on such a night as this.&nbsp; Can you come
up?&nbsp; Shall I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; Take the lantern first&mdash;take
care.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; Now the basket and the
cloak.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this done, with Edmund&rsquo;s hand, Rose
scrambled up into the loft.&nbsp; It was only the height of the
roof, and there was not room, even in the middle, to stand
upright; the rain soaked through the old thatch, the floor was of
rough boards, and there was but very little of the hay that had
served as a bed for the kittens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Edmund, this is a wretched place!&rdquo; exclaimed
Rose, as, crouching by his side, one hand in his, and the other
round his neck, she gazed around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than a prison,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I only wish I knew that others were in as good a
one.&nbsp; And you&mdash;why, Rose, how you are altered; you are
my young lady now!&nbsp; And how does my dear mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well.&nbsp; I could hardly prevail on her not to
come here to-night; but it would have been too much, she is so
weak, and takes cold so soon.&nbsp; But, Edmund, how pale you
are, how weary!&nbsp; Have you slept?&nbsp; I fear not, on these
hard boards&mdash;your wound, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hardly deserves such a dignified name as a
wound,&rdquo; said Edmund.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am more hungry than
aught else; I could have slept but for hunger, and
now&rdquo;&mdash;as he spoke he was opening the
basket&mdash;&ldquo;I shall be lodged better, I fear, than a
king, with that famous cloak.&nbsp; What a notable piece of
pasty!&nbsp; Well done, Rose!&nbsp; Are you housewife?&nbsp;
Store of candles, too.&nbsp; This is noble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How hungry you must be!&nbsp; How long is it since you
have eaten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grey sent his servant into a village to buy some bread
and cheese; we divided it when we parted, and it lasted me until
this morning.&nbsp; Since then I have fasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear brother, I wish I could do more for you; but till
Mr. Enderby goes, I cannot, for the soldiers are about the
kitchen, and our maid, Deborah, talks too much to be trustworthy,
though she is thoroughly faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is excellent fare,&rdquo; said Edmund, eating with
great relish.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now tell me of yourselves.&nbsp;
My mother is feeble and unwell, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never strong, but tolerably well at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Walter said.&nbsp; By the way, Walter is a fine
spirited fellow.&nbsp; I should like to have him with me if we
take another African voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would like nothing better, poor fellow.&nbsp; But
what strange things you have seen and done since we met!&nbsp;
How little we thought that morning that it would be six years
before we should sit side by side again!&nbsp; And Prince Rupert
is kind to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He treats me like a son or brother: never was man
kinder,&rdquo; said Edmund, warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the
children?&nbsp; I must see them before I depart.&nbsp; Little
Lucy, is she as bold and pert as she was as a young
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little changed,&rdquo; said Rose, smiling, and telling
her brother the adventures at the dinner.</p>
<p>As cheerfully as might be they talked till Edmund had finished
his meal, and then Rose begged him to let her examine and bind up
the wound.&nbsp; It was a sword-cut on the right shoulder, and,
though not very deep, had become stiff and painful from neglect,
and had soaked his sleeve deeply with blood.&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s
dexterous fingers applied the salve and linen she had brought,
and she promised that at her next visit she would bring him some
clean clothes, which was what he said he most wished for.&nbsp;
Then she arranged the large horseman&rsquo;s cloak, the hay, and
his own mantle, so well as to form, he said, the most luxurious
resting place he had seen since he left Dunbar; and rolled up in
this he lay, his head supported on his hand, talking earnestly
with her on the measures next to be taken for his safety, and on
the state of the family.&nbsp; He must be hidden there till the
chase was a little slackened, and then escape, by Bosham or some
other port, to the royal fleet, which was hovering on the
coast.&nbsp; Money, however&mdash;how was he to get a passage
without it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince, at parting&mdash;heaven knows he has little
enough himself&mdash;gave me twenty gold crowns, which he said
was my share of prize-money for our captures,&rdquo; said Edmund,
&ldquo;but this is the last of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know how we can get any,&rdquo; said
Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;We never see money.&nbsp; Our tenants, if they
pay at all, pay in kind&mdash;a side of bacon, or a sack of corn;
they are very good, poor people, and love our mother heartily, I
do believe.&nbsp; I wish I knew what was to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; said Edmund.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
been in as bad a case as this ere now, and it is something to be
near you all again.&nbsp; So you like this place, do you?&nbsp;
As well as our own home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose shook her head, and tears sprang into her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh no, Edmund; I try to think it home, and the children
feel it so, but it is not like Woodley.&nbsp; Do you remember the
dear old oak-tree, with the branches that came down so low, where
you used to swing Mary and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the high branch where I used to watch for my father
coming home from the justice-meeting.&nbsp; And the meadow where
the hounds killed the fox that had baffled them so long!&nbsp; Do
you hear anything of the place now, Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Enderby told us something,&rdquo; said Rose,
sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know who has got it, Edmund?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Master Priggins, who was once justices&rsquo;
clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Edmund.&nbsp; &ldquo;That pettifogging
scrivener in my father&rsquo;s house!&mdash;in my
ancestors&rsquo; house!&nbsp; A rogue that ought to have been
branded a dozen years ago!&nbsp; I could have stood anything but
that!&nbsp; Pretty work he is making there, I suppose!&nbsp; Go
on, Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Edmund, you know it is but what the King himself has
to bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbour&rsquo;s fare! as you say,&rdquo; replied
Edmund, with a short dry laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poverty and
wandering I could bear; peril is what any brave man naturally
seeks; the acres that have been ours for centuries could not go
in a better cause; but to hear of a rascal such as that in my
father&rsquo;s place is enough to drive one mad with rage!&nbsp;
Come, what has he been doing?&nbsp; How has he used the poor
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned out old Davy and Madge at once from keeping
the house, but Mr. Enderby took them in, and gave them a
cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what unlucky fate possessed that Enderby to
take the wrong side!&nbsp; Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could not tell us much of the place, for he cannot
endure Master Priggins, and Master Sylvester laughs at his
Puritanical manner; but he says&mdash;O Edmund&mdash;that the
fish-ponds are filled up&mdash;those dear old fish-ponds where
the water-lilies used to blow, and you once pulled me out of the
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay! we shall not know it again if ever our turn
comes, and we enjoy our own again.&nbsp; But it is of no use to
think about such matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we must be thankful that we have a home at all, and
are not like so many, who are actually come to beggary, like poor
Mrs. Forde.&nbsp; You remember her, our old clergyman&rsquo;s
widow.&nbsp; He died on board ship, and she was sent for by her
cousin, who promised her a home; but she had no money, and was
forced to walk all the way, with her two little boys, getting a
lodging at night from any loyal family who would shelter her for
the love of heaven.&nbsp; My mother wept when she saw how sadly
she was changed; we kept her with us a week to rest her, and when
she went she had our last gold carolus, little guessing, poor
soul, that it was our last.&nbsp; Then, when she was gone, my
mother called us all round her, and gave thanks that she could
still give us shelter and daily bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a Judge above!&rdquo; exclaimed Edmund;
&ldquo;yet sometimes it is hard to believe, when we see such a
state of things here below!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bathurst tells us to think it will all be right in
the other world, even if we do have to see the evil prosper
here,&rdquo; said Rose, gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sufferings will
all turn to glory, just as they did with our blessed King, out of
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edmund sat thoughtful.&nbsp; &ldquo;If our people abroad would
but hope and trust and bear as you do here, Rose.&nbsp; But I had
best not talk of these things, only your patience makes me feel
how deficient in it we are, who have not a tithe to bear of what
you have at home.&nbsp; Are you moving to go?&nbsp; Must
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear so, dear brother; the light seems to be
beginning to dawn, and if Lucy wakes and misses me&mdash;Is your
shoulder comfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never more comfortable in my life.&nbsp; My
loving duty to my dear mother.&nbsp; Farewell, you, sweet
Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, dear Edmund.&nbsp; Perhaps Walter may manage
to visit you, but do not reckon on it.&rdquo;</p>

62</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> vigils of the night had been as
unwonted for Lucy as for her sister, and she slept soundly till
Rose was already up and dressed.&nbsp; Her first reflection was
on the strange sights she had seen, followed by a doubt whether
they were real, or only a dream; but she was certain it was no
such thing; she recollected too well the chill of the stone to
her feet, and the sound of the blasts of wind.&nbsp; She wondered
over it, wished to make out the cause, but decided that she
should only be scolded for peeping, and she had better keep her
own counsel.</p>
<p>That Lucy should keep silence when she thought she knew more
than other people was, however, by no means to be expected; and
though she would say not a word to her mother or Rose, of whom
she was afraid, she was quite ready to make the most of her
knowledge with Eleanor.</p>
<p>When she came down stairs she found Walter, with his elbows on
the table and his book before him, learning the task which his
mother required of him every day; Eleanor had just come in with
her lapfull of the still lingering flowers, and called her to
help to make them up into nosegays.</p>
<p>Lucy came and sat down by her on the floor, but paid little
attention to the flowers, so intent was she on showing her
knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t know what I have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is only some nonsense,&rdquo; said
Eleanor, gravely, for she was rather apt to plume herself on
being steadier than her elder sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no nonsense,&rdquo; said Lucy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Eleanor had time to answer this speech, the mystery of
which was enhanced by a knowing little nod of the head, young Mr.
Enderby made his appearance in the hall, with a civil
good-morning to Walter, which the boy hardly deigned to
acknowledge by a gruff reply and little nod, and then going on to
the little girls, renewed with them yesterday&rsquo;s war of
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Weaving posies, little ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for rebels,&rdquo; replied Lucy, pertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I not have one poor daisy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one; the daisy is a royal flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I take one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebels take what they can&rsquo;t get fairly,&rdquo;
said Lucy, with the smartness of a forward child; and Sylvester,
laughing heartily, continued, &ldquo;What would General Cromwell
say to such a nest of little malignants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an ugly name,&rdquo; said Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite as pretty as Roundhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when you make that pretty face so sour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; interposed Lucy, &ldquo;she is sour because
I won&rsquo;t tell her my secret of the pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what?&rdquo; said Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have you!&rdquo; cried Lucy, delighted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know what became of the pigeon pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In extreme alarm and anger, Walter turned round as he caught
these words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lucy, naughty child!&rdquo; he began,
in a voice of thunder; then, recollecting the danger of exciting
further suspicion, he stammered,
&ldquo;what&mdash;what&mdash;what&mdash;are you doing here?&nbsp;
Go along to mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy rubbed her fingers into her eyes, and answered sharply,
in a pettish tone, that she was doing no harm.&nbsp; Eleanor, in
amazement, asked what could be the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intolerable!&rdquo; exclaimed Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
many girls always in the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvester Enderby could not help smiling, as he asked,
&ldquo;Is that all you have to complain of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could complain of something much worse,&rdquo;
muttered Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get away, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t at your bidding, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Walter&rsquo;s great relief, Rose entered at that moment,
and all was smooth and quiet; Lucy became silent, and the
conversation was kept up in safe terms between Rose and the young
officer.&nbsp; The colonel, it appeared, was so much better that
he intended to leave Forest Lea that very day; and it was not
long before he came down, and presently afterwards Lady Woodley,
looking very pale and exhausted, for her anxieties had kept her
awake all night.</p>
<p>After a breakfast on bread, cheese, rashers of bacon, and
beer, the horses were brought to the door, and the colonel took
his leave of Lady Woodley, thanking her much for her
hospitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it had been better worth accepting,&rdquo; said
she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it had, though not for my own sake,&rdquo; said
the colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would allow me to attempt
something in your favour.&nbsp; One thing, perhaps, you will
deign to accept.&nbsp; Every royalist house, especially those
belonging to persons engaged at Worcester, is liable to be
searched, and to have soldiers quartered on them, to prevent
fugitives from being harboured there.&nbsp; I will send Sylvester
at once to obtain a protection for you, which may prevent you
from being thus disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be a kindness, indeed,&rdquo; said Lady
Woodley, hardly able to restrain the eagerness with which she
heard the offer made, that gave the best hope of saving her
son.&nbsp; She was not certain that the colonel had not some
suspicion of the true state of the case, and would not take
notice, unwilling to ruin the son of his friend, and at the same
time reluctant to fail in his duty to his employers.</p>
<p>He soon departed; Mistress Lucy&rsquo;s farewell to Sylvester
being thus: &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Roundhead, rebel, crop-eared
traitor.&rdquo;&nbsp; At which Sylvester and his father turned
and laughed, and their two soldiers looked very much
astonished.</p>
<p>Lady Woodley called Lucy at once, and spoke to her seriously
on her forwardness and impertinence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could tell
you, Lucy, that it is not like a young lady, but I must tell you
more, it is not like a young Christian maiden.&nbsp; Do you
remember the text that I gave you to learn a little while
ago&mdash;the ornament fit for a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy hung her head, and with tears filling her eyes, as her
mother prompted her continually, repeated the text in a low
mumbling voice, half crying: &ldquo;Whose adorning, let it not be
the putting on of gold, or the plaiting of hair, or the putting
on of apparel, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, even
the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
<span class="smcap">God</span> of great price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does my little Lucy think she showed that ornament
when she pushed herself forward to talk idle nonsense, and make
herself be looked at and taken notice of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy put her finger in her mouth; she did not like to be
scolded, as she called it, gentle as her mother was, and she
would not open her mind to take in the kind reproof.</p>
<p>Lady Woodley took the old black-covered Bible, and finding two
of the verses in S. James about the government of the tongue,
desired Lucy to learn them by heart before she went out of the
house; and the little girl sat down with them in the window-seat,
in a cross impatient mood, very unfit for learning those sacred
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;She had done no harm,&rdquo; she thought;
&ldquo;she could not help it if the young gentleman would talk to
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So there she sat, with the Bible in her lap, alone, for Lady
Woodley was so harassed and unwell, in consequence of her
anxieties, that Rose had persuaded her to go and lie down on her
bed, since it would be better for her not to try to see Edmund
till the promised protection had arrived, lest suspicion should
be excited.&nbsp; Rose was busy about her household affairs;
Eleanor, a handy little person, was helping her; and Walter and
Charles were gone out to gather apples for a pudding which she
had promised them.</p>
<p>Lucy much wished to be with them; and after a long brooding
over her ill-temper, it began to wear out, not to be conquered,
but to depart of itself; she thought she might as well learn her
lesson and have done with it; so by way of getting rid of the
task, not of profiting by the warning it conveyed, she hurried
through the two verses ending with&mdash;&ldquo;Behold how great
a matter a little fire kindleth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she could say them perfectly, she raced upstairs,
and into her mother&rsquo;s room, gave her the book, and repeated
them at her fastest pace.&nbsp; Poor Lady Woodley was too weary
and languid to exert herself to speak to the little girl about
her unsuitable manner, or to try to bring the lesson home to her;
she dismissed her, only saying, &ldquo;I hope, my dear, you will
remember this,&rdquo; and away ran Lucy, first to the orchard in
search of her brothers, and not finding them there, round and
round the garden and pleasance.&nbsp; Edmund, in his
hiding-place, heard the voice calling &ldquo;Walter!&nbsp;
Charlie!&rdquo; and peeping out, caught a glimpse of a little
figure, her long frock tucked over her arm, and long locks of
dark hair blowing out from under her small, round, white
cap.&nbsp; What a pleasure it was to him to have that one view of
his little sister!</p>
<p>At last, tired with her search, Lucy returned to the house,
and there found Deborah ironing at the long table in the hall,
and crooning away her one dismal song of &ldquo;Barbara
Allen&rsquo;s cruelty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you can sing again, Deb,&rdquo; she began,
&ldquo;now the Roundheads are gone and Diggory come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girls should not meddle with what does not
concern them,&rdquo; answered Deborah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not call me a little girl,&rdquo; said
Lucy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am almost eleven years old; and I know a
secret, a real secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret, Mistress Lucy?&nbsp; Who would tell their
secrets to the like of you?&rdquo; said Deborah,
contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one told me; I found it out for myself!&rdquo; cried
Lucy, in high exultation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what became of the
pigeon pie that we thought Rose ate up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; Mistress Lucy!&rdquo; exclaimed Deborah,
pausing in her ironing, full of curiosity.</p>
<p>Lucy was delighted to detail the whole of what she had
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Deborah, &ldquo;if ever I heard tell
the like!&nbsp; That slip of a thing out in all the blackness of
the night!&nbsp; I should be afraid of my life of the ghosts and
hobgoblins.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I had rather be set up for a mark for
all the musketeers in the Parliament army, than set one foot out
of doors after dark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Deborah spoke, Walter came into the hall.&nbsp; He saw that
Lucy had observed something, and was anxious every time she
opened her lips.&nbsp; This made him rough and sharp with her,
and he instantly exclaimed, &ldquo;How now, Lucy, still
gossipping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so cross, I can&rsquo;t speak a word for
you,&rdquo; said Lucy, fretfully, walking out of the room, while
Walter, in his usual imperious way, began to shout for Diggory
and his boots.&nbsp; &ldquo;Diggory, knave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anon, sir!&rdquo; answered the dogged voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them, I say, you laggard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, sir, coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, are you, you snail?&rdquo; cried Walter,
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your heels are tardier now than they
were at Worcester!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man can&rsquo;t do more nor he can do, sir,&rdquo;
said Diggory, sullenly, as he plodded into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answering again, lubber?&rdquo; said Walter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is this what you call cleaned?&nbsp; You are not fit for
your own shoe-blacking trade!&nbsp; Get along with you!&rdquo;
and he threw the boots at Diggory in a passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
must wear them, though, as they are, or wait all day.&nbsp; Bring
them to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter had some idle notion in his head that it was
Puritanical to speak courteously to servants, and despising
Diggory for his cowardice and stupidity, he was especially
overbearing with him, and went on rating him all the time he was
putting on his boots, to go out and try to catch some fish for
the morrow&rsquo;s dinner, which was likely to be but
scanty.&nbsp; As soon as he was gone, Diggory, who had listened
in sulky silence, began to utter his complaints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicken-heart, moon-calf, awkward lubber, those be the
best words a poor fellow gets.&nbsp; I can tell Master Walter
that these are no times for gentlefolks to be hectoring,
especially when they haven&rsquo;t a penny to pay wages
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You learnt that in the wars, Diggory,&rdquo; said
Deborah, turning round, for, grumble as she might herself, she
could not bear to have a word said by anyone else against her
lady&rsquo;s family, and loved to scold her sweetheart,
Diggory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind Master Walter.&nbsp; If he has
not a penny in his pocket, and the very green coat to his back is
cut out of his grandmother&rsquo;s farthingale, more&rsquo;s the
pity.&nbsp; How should he show he is a gentleman but by hectoring
a bit now and then, &rsquo;specially to such a rogue as thou,
coming back when thy betters are lost.&nbsp; That is always the
way, as I found when I lost my real silver crown, and kept my
trumpery Parliament bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Deb!&rdquo; pleaded Diggory, &ldquo;thou knowst not
what danger is!&nbsp; I thought thou wouldst never have set eyes
on poor Diggory again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much harm would that have been,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
Deb, tossing her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;d
have broke my heart?&nbsp; That I&rsquo;ll never do for a
runaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas time to run when poor Farmer Ewins was cut
down, holloaing for quarter, and Master Edmund&rsquo;s brains
lying strewn about on the ground, for all the world like a
calf&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis your own brains be like a
calf&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Deborah.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d bargain
to eat all of Master Edmund&rsquo;s brains you ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as dead as a red herring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say he is as life-like as you or I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I saw him stretched out, covered with blood, and
a sword-cut on his head big enough to be the death of twenty
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t that colonel man, as they call him, see
him alive and merry long after?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my belief that
Master Edmund is not a dozen miles off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Edmund! hey, Deb?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never believe
that, after what I&rsquo;ve seen at Worcester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pray why does Mistress Rose save a whole pigeon
out of the pie, hide it in her lap, and steal out of the house
with it at midnight?&nbsp; Either Master Edmund is in hiding, or
some other poor gentleman from the wars, and I verily believe it
is Master Edmund himself; so a fig for his brains or yours, and
there&rsquo;s for you, for a false-tongued runaway!&nbsp; Coming,
mistress, coming!&rdquo; and away ran Deborah at a call from
Rose.</p>
<p>Now Deborah was faithful to the backbone, and would have given
all she had in the world, almost her life itself, for her lady
and the children; she was a good and honest woman in the main,
but tongue and temper were two things that she had never learnt
to restrain, and she had given her love to the first person by
whom it was sought, without consideration whether he was worthy
of affection or not.&nbsp; That Diggory was a sullen,
ill-conditioned, selfish fellow, was evident to everyone else;
but he had paid court to Deborah, and therefore the foolish woman
had allowed herself to be taken with him, see perfections in him,
promise to become his wife, and confide in him.</p>
<p>When Deborah left the hall, Diggory returned to his former
employment of chopping wood, and began to consider very intently
for him.</p>
<p>He had really believed, at the moment of his panic-terror,
that he saw Edmund Woodley fall, and had at once taken flight,
without attempting to afford him any assistance.&nbsp; The story
of the brains had, of course, been invented on the spur of the
moment, by way of excusing his flight, and he was obliged to
persist in the falsehood he had once uttered, though he was not
by any means certain that it had been his master whom he saw
killed, especially after hearing Colonel Enderby&rsquo;s
testimony.&nbsp; And now there came alluringly before him the
promise of the reward offered for the discovery of the fugitive
cavaliers, the idea of being able to rent and stock poor
Ewins&rsquo;s farm, and setting up there with Deborah.&nbsp; It
was money easily come by, he thought, and he would like to be
revenged on Master Walter, and show him that the lubber and
moon-calf could do some harm, after all.&nbsp; A relenting came
across him as he thought of his lady and Mistress Rose, though he
had no personal regard for Edmund, who had never lived at Forest
Lea; and his stolid mind was too much enclosed in selfishness to
admit much feeling for anyone.&nbsp; Besides, it might not be
Master Edmund; he was probably killed; it might be one of the
lords in the battle, or even the King himself, and that would be
worth &pound;1,000.&nbsp; Master Cantwell called them all tyrants
and sons of Belial, and what not; and though Dr. Bathurst said
differently, who was to know what was right?&nbsp; Dr. Bathurst
had had his day, and this was Cantwell&rsquo;s turn.&nbsp; There
was a comedown now of feathered hats, and point collars, and
curled hair; and leathern jerkin should have its day.&nbsp; And
as for being an informer, he would keep his own counsel; at any
rate, the reward he would have.&nbsp; It was scarcely likely to
be a hanging matter, after all; and if the gentleman, whoever he
might be, did chance to be taken, he would get off scot free, no
harm done to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Diggory Stokes, you&rsquo;re a
made man!&rdquo; he finished, throwing his bill-hook from
him.</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; Lucy, Lucy, you little thought of the harm your
curiosity and chattering had done, as you saw Diggory stealing
along the side of the wood, in the direction leading to
Chichester!</p>
<h2><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the afternoon Lady Woodley was
so much better as to be able to come downstairs, and all the
party sat round the fire in the twilight.&nbsp; Walter was just
come in from his fishing, bringing a basket of fine trout;
Eleanor and Charles were admiring their beautiful red spots, Lucy
wondering what made him so late, while he cast a significant look
at his eldest sister, showing her that he had been making a visit
to Edmund.</p>
<p>At that moment a loud authoritative knocking was heard at the
door; Walter shouted to Diggory to open it, and was answered by
Deborah&rsquo;s shrill scream from the kitchen, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not here, sir; I&rsquo;ve not seen him since you threw your boots
at him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another thundering knock brought Deborah to open the door; and
what was the dismay of the mother and children as there entered
six tall men, their buff coats, steeple-crowned hats, plain
collars, and thick calf-skin boots, marking them as Parliamentary
soldiers.&nbsp; With a shriek of terror the little ones clung
round their mother, while he who, by his orange scarf, was
evidently the commanding officer, standing in the middle of the
hall, with his hat on, announced, in a Puritanical tone,
&ldquo;We are here by order of his Excellency, General Cromwell,
to search for and apprehend the body of the desperate malignant
Edmund Woodley, last seen in arms against the Most High Court of
Parliament.&nbsp; Likewise to arrest the person of Dame Mary
Woodley, widow, suspected of harbouring and concealing
traitors:&rdquo; and he advanced to lay his hand upon her.&nbsp;
Walter, in an impulse of passion, rushed forward, and aimed a
blow at him with the butt-end of the fishing-rod; but it was the
work of a moment to seize the boy and tie his hands, while his
mother earnestly implored the soldier to have pity on him, and
excuse his thoughtless haste to protect her.</p>
<p>The officer sat down in the arm-chair, and without replying to
Lady Woodley, ordered a soldier to bring the boy before him, and
spoke thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Hear me, son of an ungodly seed.&nbsp;
So merciful are the lessons of the light that thou contemnest,
that I will even yet overlook and forgive the violence wherewith
thou didst threaten my life, so thou wilt turn again, and confess
where thou hast hidden the bloody-minded traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house harbours no traitor,&rdquo; answered Walter,
undauntedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou art too hardened to confess,&rdquo; continued
the officer, frowning, and speaking slowly and sternly, as he
kept his eyes steadily fixed on Walter, &ldquo;if thou wilt not
reveal his hiding-place, I lead thee hence to abide the penalty
of attempted murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite ready,&rdquo; answered Walter, returning
frown for frown, and not betraying how his heart throbbed.</p>
<p>The officer signed to the soldier, who roughly dragged him
aside by the cord that tied his hands, cutting them severely,
though he disdained to show any sign of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young maiden,&rdquo; continued the rebel, turning to
Rose, &ldquo;what sayest thou?&nbsp; Wilt thou see thy brother
led away to death, when the breath of thy mouth might save
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Rose turned as pale as death, but her answer was steady:
&ldquo;I will say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little ones, then,&rdquo; said the officer, fiercely,
&ldquo;speak, or you shall taste the rod.&nbsp; Do you know where
your brother is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; sobbed Lucy; and her mother added,
&ldquo;They know nothing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is loss of time to stand parleying with women and
children,&rdquo; said the officer, rising.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; to one of his men, &ldquo;keep the
door.&nbsp; Let none quit the chamber, and mark the
children&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; The rest with me.&nbsp; Where is the
fellow that brought the tidings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diggory, who had slunk out of sight, was pushed forward by two
of the soldiers, and at the same time there was a loud scream
from Deborah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Diggory, is it you?&nbsp;
Oh! my Lady, my Lady, forgive me!&nbsp; I meant no harm!&nbsp;
Oh! who would have thought it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And in an agony of
distress, she threw her apron over her face, and, sinking on the
bench, rocked herself to and fro, sobbing violently.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the officer and his men, all but the
sentinel, had left the room to search for the fugitive, leaving
Lady Woodley sitting exhausted and terrified in her chair, the
little ones clinging around her, Walter standing opposite, with
his hands bound; Rose stood by him, her arm round his neck, proud
of his firmness, but in dreadful terror for him, and in such
suspense for Edmund, that her whole being seemed absorbed in
agonised prayer.&nbsp; Deborah&rsquo;s sobs, and the
children&rsquo;s frightened weeping, were all the sounds that
could be heard; Rose was obliged to attempt to soothe them, but
her first kind word to Deborah produced a fresh burst of violent
weeping, and then a loud lamentation: &ldquo;Oh! the
rogue&mdash;the rogue.&nbsp; If I could have dreamt
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo; exclaimed Walter,
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, stop your crying.&nbsp; What have
you done, Deb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought&mdash;Oh! if I had known what was in the
villain!&rdquo; continued Deborah, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner have
bit out my tongue than have said one word to him about the pigeon
pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigeon pie!&rdquo; repeated Rose.</p>
<p>Lucy now gave a cry, for she was, with all her faults, a
truth-telling child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother! mother!&nbsp; I told
Deb about the pigeon pie!&nbsp; Oh, what have I done?&nbsp; Was
it for Edmund?&nbsp; Is Edmund here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to increase the danger and perplexity, the other two
children exclaimed together, &ldquo;Is Edmund here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, my dears, be quiet; I cannot answer you
now,&rdquo; whispered Lady Woodley, trying to silence them by
caresses, and looking with terror at the rigid, stern guard, who,
instead of remaining at the door where he had been posted, had
come close up to them, and sat himself down at the end of the
table, as if to catch every word they uttered.</p>
<p>Eleanor and Charles obeyed their mother&rsquo;s command that
they should be silent; Rose took Lucy on her lap, let her rest
her head on her shoulder, and whispered to her that she should
hear and tell all another time, but she must be quiet now, and
listen.&nbsp; Deborah kept her apron over her face, and Walter,
leaning his shoulder against the wall, stood gazing at them all;
and while he was intently watching for every sound that could
enable him to judge whether the search was successful or not, at
the same time his heart was beating and his head swimming at the
threat of the rebel.&nbsp; Was he to die?&nbsp; To be taken away
from that bright world, from sunshine, youth, and health, from
his mother, and all of them, and be laid, a stiff mangled corpse,
in some cold, dark, unregarded grave; his pulses, that beat so
fast, all still and silent&mdash;senseless, motionless, like the
birds he had killed?&nbsp; And that was not all: that other
world!&nbsp; To enter on what would last for ever and ever and
ever, on a state which he had never dwelt on or realised to
himself, filled him with a blank, shuddering awe; and next came a
worse, a sickening thought: if his feeling for the bliss of
heaven was almost distaste, could he be fit for it? could he dare
to hope for it?&nbsp; It was his Judge Whom he was about to meet,
and he had been impatient and weary of Bible and Catechism, and
Dr. Bathurst&rsquo;s teaching; he had been inattentive and
careless at his prayers; he had been disobedient and unruly,
violent, and unkind!&nbsp; Such a horror and agony came over the
poor boy, so exceeding a dread of death, that he was ready at
that moment to struggle to do anything to save himself; but there
came the recollection that the price of his rescue must be the
betrayal of Edmund.&nbsp; He would almost have spoken at that
instant; the next he sickened at the thought.&nbsp; Never,
never&mdash;he could not, would not; better not live at all than
be a traitor!&nbsp; He was too confused and anxious to pray, for
he had not taught himself to fix his attention in quiet
moments.&nbsp; He would not speak before the rebel soldier; but
only looked with an earnest gaze at his sister, who, as their
eyes met, understood all it conveyed.</p>
<p>His mother, after the first moment&rsquo;s fright, had
reassured herself somewhat on his account; he was so mere a boy
that it was not likely that Algernon Sydney, who then commanded
at Chichester, would put him to death; a short imprisonment was
the worst that was likely to befall him; and though that was
enough to fill her with terror and anxiety, it could at that
moment be scarcely regarded in comparison with her fears for her
eldest son.</p>
<p>A long time passed away, so long, that they began to hope that
the enemies might be baffled in their search, in spite of
Diggory&rsquo;s intimate knowledge of every nook and
corner.&nbsp; They had been once to the shrubbery, and had been
heard tramping back to the stable, where they were welcome to
search as long as they chose, then to the barn-yard, all over the
house from garret to cellar.&nbsp; Was it over?&nbsp; Joy!
joy!&nbsp; But the feet were heard turning back to the pleasance,
as though to recommence the search, and ten minutes after the
steps came nearer.&nbsp; The rebel officer entered the hall
first, but, alas! behind him came, guarded by two soldiers,
Edmund Woodley himself, his step firm, his head erect, and his
hands unbound.&nbsp; His mother sank back in her chair, and he,
going straight up to her, knelt on one knee before her, saying,
&ldquo;Mother, dear mother, your blessing.&nbsp; Let me see your
face again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw her arms round his neck, &ldquo;My son! and is it
thus we meet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only meet as we parted,&rdquo; he answered firmly
and cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still sufferers in the same good
cause; still, I trust, with the same willing hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;I must see
you safely bestowed for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, gentlemen,&rdquo; entreated Lady
Woodley.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is six years since I saw my son, and
this may be our last meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp; She led him to the
light, and looked earnestly up into his face, saying, with a
smile, which had in it much of pride and pleasure, as well as
sadness, &ldquo;How you are altered, Edmund!&nbsp; See, Rose, how
brown he is, and how much darker his hair has grown; and does not
his moustache make him just like your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my little sisters,&rdquo; said Edmund.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Lucy, I know your little round face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sobbed Lucy, &ldquo;is it my fault?&nbsp;
Can you pardon me?&nbsp; The pigeon pie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo; asked Edmund, turning to
Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you take it out at night, Rose,&rdquo; said poor
Lucy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told Deb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And poor Deborah,&rdquo; added Rose, &ldquo;from the
same thoughtlessness repeated her chatter to Diggory, who has
betrayed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cowardly villain,&rdquo; cried Walter, who had come
forward to the group round his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Walter,&rdquo; said Edmund.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what
do I see?&nbsp; Your hands bound?&nbsp; You a
prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Walter was rash enough to attempt
resistance,&rdquo; said his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said Edmund, turning to the rebel
captain, &ldquo;you attach great importance to the struggles of a
boy of thirteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blow with the butt-end of a fishing-rod is no joke
from boy or man,&rdquo; answered the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When last I served in England,&rdquo; continued the
cavalier, &ldquo;Cromwell&rsquo;s Ironsides did not take notice
of children with fishing-rods.&nbsp; You can have no warrant, no
order, or whatever you pretend to act by, against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;no, sir; but&mdash;however, the young
gentleman has had a lesson, and I do not care if I do loose his
hands.&nbsp; Here, unfasten him.&nbsp; But I cannot permit him to
be at large while you are in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, perhaps you will allow him to share my
chamber.&nbsp; We have been separated for so many years, and it
may be our last meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let it be.&nbsp; Since you are pleased to be
conformable, sir, I am willing to oblige you,&rdquo; answered the
rebel, whose whole demeanour had curiously changed in the
presence of one of such soldierly and gentleman-like bearing as
Edmund, prisoner though he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, madam, to your
own chamber.&nbsp; You will all meet to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, mother,&rdquo; said Edmund.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sleep well; think this is but a dream, and only remember
that your eldest son is in your own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, my brave boy,&rdquo; said Lady Woodley, as
she embraced him ardently.&nbsp; &ldquo;A comfort, indeed, I have
in knowing that with your father&rsquo;s face you have his
steadfast, loving, unselfish heart.&nbsp; We meet
to-morrow.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> blessing
be upon you, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And tenderly embracing the children she left the hall,
followed by a soldier, who was to guard her door, and allow no
one to enter.&nbsp; Edmund next kissed his sisters and little
Charles, affectionately wishing them good-night, and assuring the
sobbing Lucy of his pardon.&nbsp; Rose whispered to him to say
something to comfort Deborah, who continued to weep
piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deborah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must thank you for
your long faithful service to my mother in her poverty and
distress.&nbsp; I am sure you knew not that you were doing me any
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; cried poor Deborah, &ldquo;Oh
don&rsquo;t speak so kind!&nbsp; I had rather stand up to be a
mark for all the musketeers in the Parliament army than be where
I am now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edmund did not hear half what she said, for he and Walter were
obliged to hasten upstairs to the chamber which was to be their
prison for the night.&nbsp; Rose, at the same time, led away the
children, poor little Charles almost asleep in the midst of the
confusion.</p>
<p>Deborah&rsquo;s troubles were not over yet; the captain called
for supper, and seeing Walter&rsquo;s basket of fish, ordered her
to prepare them at once for him.&nbsp; Afraid to refuse, she took
them down to the kitchen, and proceeded to her cookery, weeping
and lamenting all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the sweet generous-hearted young gentleman!&nbsp;
That I should have been the death of such as he, and he thanking
me for my poor services!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis little I could do, with
my crooked temper, that plagues all I love the very best, and my
long tongue!&nbsp; Oh that it had been bitten out at the
root!&nbsp; I wish&mdash;I wish I was a mark for all the
musketeers in the Parliament army this minute!&nbsp; And Diggory,
the rogue!&nbsp; Oh, after having known him all my life, who
would have thought of his turning informer?&nbsp; Why was not he
killed in the great fight?&nbsp; It would have broke my heart
less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And having set her fish to boil, Deborah sank on the chair,
her apron over her head, and proceeded to rock herself backwards
and forwards as before.&nbsp; She was startled by a touch, and a
lumpish voice, attempted to be softened into an insinuating
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, Deb, don&rsquo;t take on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprung up as if an adder had stung her, and jumped away
from him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! is it you?&nbsp; Dost dare to speak to
an honest girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, don&rsquo;t be fractious, my pretty
one,&rdquo; said Diggory, in the amiable tones that had once
gained her heart.</p>
<p>But now her retort was in a still sharper, more angry
key.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your&rsquo;n, indeed!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather
stand up to be a mark for all the musketeers in the Parliament
army, as poor Master Edmund is like to be, all along of
you.&nbsp; O Diggory Stokes,&rdquo; she added ruefully,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not have believed it of you, if my own father
had sworn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, Deb!&rdquo; said Diggory, rather
sheepishly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve done hanging the
folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be for putting me off with such
trash,&rdquo; she returned, more passionately;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve murdered him as much as if you had cut his
throat, and pretty nigh Master Walter into the bargain; and
you&rsquo;ve broke my lady&rsquo;s heart, you, as was born on her
land and fed with her bread.&nbsp; And now you think to make up
to me, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it all along of you I did it?&nbsp; For
your sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what would you be pleased to say next?&rdquo;
cried Deb, her voice rising in shrillness with her
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, Deb,&rdquo; said Diggory, showing a heavy
leathern bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;No more toiling in this ruinous old
hall, with scanty scraps, hard words, and no wages; but a tidy
little homestead, pig, cow, and horse, your own.&nbsp; See here,
Deb,&rdquo; and he held up a piece of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Diggory, grinning, and jingling the
bag, &ldquo;and there be plenty more where that came
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the price of Master Edmund&rsquo;s
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye say that now, Deb; &rsquo;tis all for
you!&rdquo; he answered, thinking he was prevailing because she
was less violent, too stupid to perceive the difference between
her real indignation and perpetual scolding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you still have the face to tell me so!&rdquo; she
burst out, still more vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you,
I&rsquo;d rather serve my lady and Mistress Rose, if they had not
a crust to give me, than roll in gold with a rogue like
you.&nbsp; Get along with you, and best get out of the county,
for not a boy in Dorset but will cry shame on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Deb, Deb,&rdquo; he still pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have it, then!&rdquo;&nbsp; And dealing him a
hearty box on the ear, away ran Deborah.&nbsp; Down fell bag,
money, and all, and Diggory stood gaping and astounded for a
moment, then proceeded to grope after the coins on his hands and
knees.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice exclaimed, &ldquo;How now, knave, stealing
thy mistress&rsquo;s goods?&rdquo; and a tall, grim,
steeple-hatted figure, armed with a formidable halberd, stood
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good master corporal,&rdquo; he began, trembling; but
the soldier would not hear him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away with thee, son of iniquity or I will straightway
lay mine halberd about thine ears.&nbsp; I bethink me that I saw
thee at the fight of Worcester, on the part of the man Charles
Stuart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Diggory judged it prudent to slink away
through the back door.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; continued the
Puritan corporal, as he swept the silver into his pouch,
&ldquo;and so the gains of iniquity fall into the hands of the
righteous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Edmund and Walter had been conducted up stairs
to Walter&rsquo;s bed-room, and there locked in, a sentinel
standing outside the door.&nbsp; No sooner were they there than
Walter swung himself round with a gesture of rage and
despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;The villains! the rogues!&nbsp; To be
betrayed by such a wretch, who has eaten our bread all his
life.&nbsp; O Edmund, Edmund!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most unusual, as well as an unhappy
chance,&rdquo; returned Edmund.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hitherto it has
generally happened that servants have given remarkable proofs of
fidelity.&nbsp; Of course this fellow can have no attachment for
me; but I should have thought my mother&rsquo;s gentle kindness
must have won the love of all who came near her, both for herself
and all belonging to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A recollection crossed Walter: he stood for a few moments in
silence, then suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;The surly rascal!&nbsp;
I verily believe it was all spite at me, for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Edmund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For rating him as he deserved,&rdquo; answered
Walter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I had given it to him more soundly,
traitor as he is.&nbsp; No, no, after all,&rdquo; added he,
hesitating, &ldquo;perhaps if I had been
civiller&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should guess you to be a little too prompt of
tongue,&rdquo; said Edmund, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is what my mother is always blaming me for,&rdquo;
said Walter; &ldquo;but really, now, Edmund, doesn&rsquo;t it
savour of the crop-ear to be picking one&rsquo;s words to every
rogue in one&rsquo;s way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Walter, you should not ask me that question, just
coming from France.&nbsp; There we hold that the best token, in
our poverty, that we are cavaliers and gentlemen, is to be
courteous to all, high and low.&nbsp; You should see our young
King&rsquo;s frank bright courtesy; and as to the little King
Louis, he is the very pink of civility to every old
<i>poissarde</i> in the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter coloured a little, and looked confused; then repeated,
as if consoling himself, &ldquo;He is a sullen, spiteful,
good-for-nothing rogue, whom hanging is too good for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us spend our whole night in abusing
him,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;I want to make the most of you,
Walter, for this our last sight of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Edmund! you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;they shall
not&mdash;you shall escape.&nbsp; Oh! is there no way out of this
room?&rdquo; cried Walter, running round it like one distracted,
and bouncing against the wainscot, as if he would shake it
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! this is of no use, Walter,&rdquo; said his
brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;The window is, I see, too high from the
ground, and there is no escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter stood regarding him with blank dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing I am thankful to them,&rdquo; continued
Edmund; &ldquo;I thought they might have shot me down before my
mother&rsquo;s door, and so filled the place with horror for her
ever after.&nbsp; Now they have given me time for preparation,
and she will grow accustomed to the thought of losing
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think there is no hope?&nbsp; O
Edmund!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see none.&nbsp; Sydney is unlikely to spare a friend
of Prince Rupert&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter squeezed his hands fast together.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
how&mdash;how can you?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think me cowardly,
Edmund, for that I will never be; never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, I am sure,&rdquo; repeated Edmund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when that base Puritan threatened me just
now&mdash;perhaps it was foolish to believe him&mdash;I could
answer him freely enough; but when I thought of dying,
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not stood face to face with death so often as
I have, Walter,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;nor have you led so
wandering and weary a life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I could lead any sort of life rather than
die,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, our flesh will shrink and tremble at the thought
of the Judge we must meet,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;but He is a
gracious Judge, and He knows that it is rather than turn from our
duty that we are exposed to death.&nbsp; We may have a good hope,
sinners as we are in His sight, that He will grant us His mercy,
and be with us when the time comes.&nbsp; But it is late, Walter,
we ought to rest, to fit ourselves for what may come
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edmund knelt in prayer, his young brother feeling meantime
both sorrowful and humiliated, loving Edmund and admiring him
heartily, following what he had said, grieving and rebelling at
the fate prepared for him, and at the same time sensible of shame
at having so far fallen short of all he had hoped to feel and to
prove himself in the time of trial.&nbsp; He had been of very
little use to Edmund; his rash interference had only done harm,
and added to his mother&rsquo;s distress; he had been nothing but
a boy throughout, and instead of being a brave champion, he had
been in such an agony of terror at an empty threat, that if the
rebel captain had been in the room, he might almost, at one
moment, have betrayed his brother.&nbsp; Poor Walter! how he felt
what it was never to have learnt self-control!</p>
<p>The brothers arranged themselves for the night without
undressing, both occupying Walter&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; They were
both too anxious and excited to sleep, and Walter sat up after a
time, listening more calmly to Edmund, who was giving him last
messages for Prince Rupert and his other friends, should Walter
ever meet them, and putting much in his charge, as now likely to
become heir of Woodley Hall and Forest Lea, warning him earnestly
to protect his mother and sisters, and be loyal to his King,
avoiding all compromise with the enemies of the Church.</p>
<h2><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Forest Lea</span> that night was a house
of sorrow: the mother and two sons were prisoners in their
separate rooms, and the anxieties for the future were
dreadful.&nbsp; Rose longed to see and help her mother, dreading
the effect of such misery, to be borne in loneliness, by the weak
frame, shattered by so many previous sufferings.&nbsp; How was
she to undergo all that might yet be in store for
her&mdash;imprisonment, ill-treatment, above all, the loss of her
eldest son?&nbsp; For there was little hope for Edmund.&nbsp; As
a friend and follower of Prince Rupert, he was a marked man; and
besides, Algernon Sydney, the commander of the nearest body of
forces, was known to be a good deal under the influence of the
present owner of Woodley, who was likely to be glad to see the
rightful heir removed from his path.</p>
<p>Rose perceived all this, and her heart failed her, but she had
no time to pause on the thought.&nbsp; The children must be
soothed and put to bed, and a hard matter it was to comfort poor
little Lucy, perhaps the most of all to be pitied.&nbsp; She
relieved herself by pouring out the whole confession to Rose,
crying bitterly, while Eleanor hurried on distressing questions
whether they would take mamma away, and what they would do to
Edmund.&nbsp; Now it came back to Lucy, &ldquo;O if I had but
minded what mamma said about keeping my tongue in order; but now
it is too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose, after doing her best to comfort them, and listening as
near to her mother&rsquo;s door as she dared, to hear if she were
weeping, went to her own room.&nbsp; It adjoined Walter&rsquo;s,
though the doors did not open into the same passage; and she shut
that which closed in the long gallery, where her room and that of
her sisters were, so that the Roundhead sentry might not be able
to look down it.</p>
<p>As soon as she was in her own room, she threw herself on her
knees, and prayed fervently for help and support in their dire
distress.&nbsp; In the stillness, as she knelt, she heard an
interchange of voices, which she knew must be those of her
brothers in the next room.&nbsp; She went nearer to that side,
and heard them more distinctly.&nbsp; She was even able to
distinguish when Edmund spoke, and when Walter broke forth in
impatient exclamations.&nbsp; A sudden thought struck her.&nbsp;
She might be able to join in the conversation.&nbsp; There had
once been a door between the two rooms, but it had long since
been stopped up, and the recess of the doorway was occupied by a
great oaken cupboard, in which were preserved all the old stores
of rich farthingales of brocade, and velvet mantles, which had
been heirlooms from one Dame of Mowbray to another, till poverty
had caused them to be cut up and adapted into garments for the
little Woodleys.</p>
<p>Rose looked anxiously at the carved doors of the old
wardrobe.&nbsp; Had she the key?&nbsp; She felt in her
pouch.&nbsp; Yes, she had not given it back to her mother since
taking out the sheets for Mr. Enderby.&nbsp; She unlocked the
folding doors, and, pushing aside some of the piles of old
garments, saw a narrow line of light between the boards, and
heard the tones almost as clearly as if she was in the same
room.</p>
<p>Eager to tell Edmund how near she was, she stretched herself
out, almost crept between the shelves, leant her head against the
board on the opposite side, and was about to speak, when she
found that it yielded in some degree to her touch.&nbsp; A gleam
of hope darted across her, she drew back, fetched her light,
tried with her hand, and found that the back of the cupboard was
in fact a door, secured on her side by a wooden bolt, which there
was no difficulty in undoing.&nbsp; Another push, and the door
yielded below, but only so as to show that there must be another
fastening above.&nbsp; Rose clambered up the shelves, and
sought.&nbsp; Here it was!&nbsp; It was one of the secret
communications that were by no means uncommon in old halls in
those times of insecurity.&nbsp; Edmund might yet be saved!&nbsp;
Trembling with the excess of her delight in her new-found hope,
she forced out the second bolt, and pushed again.&nbsp; The door
gave way, the light widened upon her, and she saw into the
room!&nbsp; Edmund was lying on the bed, Walter sitting at his
feet.</p>
<p>Both started as what had seemed to be part of the wainscoted
wall opened, but Edmund prevented Walter&rsquo;s exclamation by a
sign to be silent, and the next moment Rose&rsquo;s face was seen
squeezing between the shelves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edmund!&nbsp; Can you get through here?&rdquo; she
exclaimed in a low eager whisper.</p>
<p>Edmund was immediately by her side, kissing the flushed
anxious forehead: &ldquo;My gallant Rose!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank heaven! thank heaven! now you may be
safe!&rdquo; continued Rose, still in the same whisper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never knew this was a door till this moment.&nbsp;
Heaven sent the discovery on purpose for your safety!&nbsp; Hush,
Walter!&nbsp; Oh remember the soldier outside!&rdquo; as Walter
was about to break out into tumultuous tokens of gladness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But can you get through, Edmund?&nbsp; Or perhaps we might
move out some of the shelves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easily done,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;but I
know not.&nbsp; Even if I should escape, it would be only to fall
into the hands of some fresh troop of enemies, and I cannot go
and leave my mother to their mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could do nothing to save her,&rdquo; said Rose,
&ldquo;and all that they may do to her would scarcely hurt her if
she thought you were safe.&nbsp; O Edmund! think of her joy in
finding you were escaped! the misery of her anxiety
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet to leave her thus!&nbsp; You had not told me half
the change in her!&nbsp; I know not how to go!&rdquo; said
Edmund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must, you must!&rdquo; said Rose and Walter, both
at once.&nbsp; And Rose added, &ldquo;Your death would kill her,
I do believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then; but I do not see my way even when I have
squeezed between your shelves, my little sister.&nbsp; Every port
is beset, and our hiding places here can no longer serve
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;this is what my mother
and I had planned before.&nbsp; The old clergyman of this parish,
Dr. Bathurst, lives in a little house at Bosham, with his
daughter, and maintains himself by teaching the wealthier boys of
the town.&nbsp; Now, if you could ride to him to-night, he would
be most glad to serve you, both as a cavalier, and for my
mother&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He would find some place of
concealment, and watch for the time when you may attempt to cross
the Channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edmund considered, and made her repeat her explanation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, that might answer,&rdquo; he said at length; &ldquo;I
take you for my general, sweet Rose.&nbsp; But how am I to find
your good doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Rose, after considering a little
while, &ldquo;that I had better go with you.&nbsp; I could ride
behind you on your horse, if the rebels have not found him, and I
know the town, and Dr. Bathurst&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp; I only
cannot think what is to be done about Walter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind me,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;they cannot
hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you will be prudent, and not provoke
them,&rdquo; said Edmund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know!&rdquo; cried Rose; &ldquo;wear my gown and
hood! these men have only seen us by candle-light, and will never
find you out if you will only be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wear girl&rsquo;s trumpery!&rdquo; exclaimed Walter,
in such indignation that Edmund smiled, saying, &ldquo;If
Rose&rsquo;s wit went with her gown, you might be glad of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a good girl enough,&rdquo; said Walter,
&ldquo;but as to my putting on her petticoat trash, that&rsquo;s
all nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me this once, dear Walter,&rdquo; pleaded
Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there is a pursuit, and they fancy you and
Edmund are gone together, it will quite mislead them to hear only
of a groom riding before a young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something in that,&rdquo; said Walter,
&ldquo;but a pretty sort of lady I shall make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you consent?&nbsp; Thank you, dear Walter.&nbsp;
Now, will you help me into your room, and I&rsquo;ll put two
rolls of clothes to bed, that the captain may find his prisoners
fast asleep to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter could hardly help laughing aloud with delight at the
notion of the disappointment of the rebels.&nbsp; The next thing
was to consider of Edmund&rsquo;s equipment; Rose turned over her
ancient hoards in vain, everything that was not too remarkable
had been used for the needs of the family, and he must go in his
present blood-stained buff coat, hoping to enter Bosham too early
in the morning for gossips to be astir.&nbsp; Then she dressed
Walter in her own clothes, not without his making many faces of
disgust, especially when she fastened his long curled love-locks
in a knot behind, tried to train little curls over the sides of
his face, and drew her black silk hood forward so as to shade
it.&nbsp; They were nearly of the same height and complexion, and
Edmund pronounced that Walter made a very pretty girl, so like
Rose that he should hardly have known them apart, which seemed to
vex the boy more than all.</p>
<p>There had been a sort of merriment while this was doing, but
when it was over, and the moment came when the brother and sister
must set off, there was lingering, sorrow, and reluctance.&nbsp;
Edmund felt severely the leaving his mother in the midst of
peril, brought upon her for his sake, and his one brief sight of
his home had made him cling the closer to it, and stirred up in
double force the affections for mother, brothers, and sisters,
which, though never extinct, had been comparatively dormant while
he was engaged in stirring scenes abroad.&nbsp; Now that he had
once more seen the gentle loving countenance of his mother, and
felt her tender, tearful caress, known that noble-minded Rose,
and had a glimpse of those pretty little sisters, there was such
a yearning for them through his whole being, that it seemed to
him as if he might as well die as continue to be cast up and down
the world far from them.</p>
<p>Rose felt as if she was abandoning her mother by going from
home at such a time, when perhaps she should find on her return
that she had been carried away to prison.&nbsp; She could not
bear to think of being missed on such a morning that was likely
to ensue, but she well knew that the greatest good she could do
would be to effect the rescue of her brother, and she could not
hesitate a moment.&nbsp; She crowded charge after charge upon
Walter, with many a message for her mother, promise to return as
soon as possible, and entreaty for pardon for leaving her in such
a strait; and Edmund added numerous like parting greetings, with
counsel and entreaties that she would ask for Colonel
Enderby&rsquo;s interference, which might probably avail to save
her from further imprisonment and sequestration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Walter.&nbsp; In three or four years, if
matters are not righted before that, perhaps, if you can come to
me, I may find employment for you in Prince Rupert&rsquo;s fleet,
or the Duke of York&rsquo;s troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Edmund, thanks! that would be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter had not time to finish, for Rose kissed him, left her
love and duty to her mother with him, bade him remember he was a
lady, and then holding Edmund by the hand, both with their shoes
off, stole softly down the stairs in the dark.</p>
<h2><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> pacing up and down
Rose&rsquo;s room till he was tired, Walter sat down to rest, for
Rose had especially forbidden him to lie down, lest he should
derange his hair.&nbsp; He grew very sleepy, and at last, with
his arms crossed on the table, and his forehead resting on them,
fell sound asleep, and did not awaken till it was broad daylight,
and calls of &ldquo;Rose!&nbsp; Rose!&rdquo; were heard outside
the locked door.</p>
<p>He was just going to call out that Rose was not here, when he
luckily recollected that he was Rose, pulled his hood forward,
and opened the door.</p>
<p>He was instantly surrounded by the three children, who, poor
little things, feeling extremely forlorn and desolate without
their mother, all gathered round him, Lucy and Eleanor seizing
each a hand, and Charles clinging to the skirts of his
dress.&nbsp; He by no means understood this; and Rose was so used
to it, as to have forgotten he would not like it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How you crowd?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Rose,&rdquo; began Deborah, coming half way up
stairs&mdash;Lucy let go his hand, but Charles instantly grasped
it, and he felt as if he could not move.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be troublesome, children,&rdquo; said he, trying to shake them
off; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you come near one without pulling off
one&rsquo;s hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress!&rdquo; continued Deborah; but as he forgot he
was addressed, and did not immediately attend, she exclaimed,
&ldquo;Oh, she won&rsquo;t even look at me!&nbsp; I thought she
had forgiven me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgiven you!&rdquo; said he, starting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense; what&rsquo;s all this about?&nbsp; You
were a fool, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deborah stared at this most unwonted address on the part of
her young lady; and Lucy, a sudden light breaking on her, smiled
at Eleanor, and held up her finger.&nbsp; Deborah proceeded with
her inquiry: &ldquo;Mistress Rose, shall I take some breakfast to
my lady, and the young gentlemen, poor souls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
wait a bit.&nbsp; Only to my mother, I mean, just at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the soldiers,&rdquo; continued
Deborah&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;re roaring for breakfast; what
shall I give them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A halter,&rdquo; he had almost said, but he caught
himself up in time, and answered, &ldquo;What you
can&mdash;bread, beef, beer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bread! beef! beer!&rdquo; almost shrieked Deborah,
&ldquo;when she knows the colonel man had the last of our beer;
beef we have not seen for two Christmases, and bread,
there&rsquo;s barely enough for my lady and the children, till we
bake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever there is, then,&rdquo; said Walter,
anxious to get rid of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could fry some bacon,&rdquo; pursued Deborah,
&ldquo;only I don&rsquo;t know whether to cut the new flitch so
soon; and there be some cabbages in the garden.&nbsp; Should I
fry or boil them, Mistress Rose?&nbsp; The bottom is out of the
frying-pan, and the tinker is not come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tinker was too much for poor Walter&rsquo;s patience, and
flinging away from her, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Mercy on me, woman,
you&rsquo;ll plague the life out of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Deborah stood aghast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mistress Rose! what is
it? you look wildly, I declare, and your hood is all I
don&rsquo;t know how.&nbsp; Shall I set it right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business, and I&rsquo;ll mind
mine!&rdquo; cried Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack! alack!&rdquo; lamented Deborah, as she hastily
retreated down stairs, Charlie running after her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mistress Rose is gone clean demented with trouble, and
that is the worst that has befallen this poor house
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Lucy, as soon as she was gone;
&ldquo;I have held my tongue this time.&nbsp; O Walter, you
don&rsquo;t do it a bit like Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Rose!&rdquo; said Eleanor.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
did you get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;it is hard that,
whatever we do, women and babies are mixed up with it.&nbsp; I
must trust you since you have found me out, but mind, Lucy, not
one word or look that can lead anyone to guess what I am telling
you.&nbsp; Edmund is safe out of this house, Rose is gone with
him&mdash;&rsquo;tis safest not to say where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is not she coming back?&rdquo; asked Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, very soon&mdash;to-day, or to-morrow
perhaps.&nbsp; So I am Rose till she comes back, and little did I
guess what I was undertaking!&nbsp; I never was properly thankful
till now that I was not born a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t stride along so, or they will find you
out,&rdquo; exclaimed Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t mince and amble, that is worse!&rdquo;
added Lucy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh you will make me laugh in spite of
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&nbsp; I shall shut myself into my&mdash;her
room, and see nobody!&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;you must keep
Charlie off, Lucy, and don&rsquo;t let Deb drive me
distracted.&nbsp; I dare say, if necessary, I can fool it enough
for the rebels, who never spoke to a gentlewoman in their
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only tell me, how did you get out?&rdquo; said
Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Miss Curiosity must rest without knowing,&rdquo;
said Walter, shutting the door in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be curious, dear Lucy,&rdquo; said
Eleanor, taking her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall know in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not, I am not,&rdquo; said Lucy,
magnanimously.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will not say one single word,
Eleanor, and I will not look as if I knew anything.&nbsp; Come
down, and we will see if we can do any of Rose&rsquo;s work, for
we must be very useful, you know; I wish I might tell poor Deb
that Edmund is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter was wise in secluding himself in his disguise.&nbsp; He
remained undisturbed for some time, while Deborah&rsquo;s
unassisted genius was exerted to provide the rebels with
breakfast.&nbsp; The first interruption was from Eleanor, who
knocked at the door, beginning to call &ldquo;Walter,&rdquo; and
then hastily turning it into &ldquo;Rose!&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened,
and she said, with tears in her eyes, &ldquo;O Walter, Walter,
the wicked men are really going to take dear mother away to
prison.&nbsp; She is come down with her cloak and hood on, and is
asking for you&mdash;Rose I mean&mdash;to wish good-bye.&nbsp;
Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;and
Edmund&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were just sending up to call him,&rdquo; said
Eleanor; &ldquo;they will find it out in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor&rsquo;s speech was cut short by a tremendous uproar in
the next room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Where are
they?&nbsp; How now?&nbsp; Escaped!&rdquo; with many confused
exclamations, and much trampling of heavy boots.&nbsp; Eleanor
stood frightened, Walter clapped his hands, cut a very unfeminine
caper, clenched his fist, and shook it at the wall, and exclaimed
in an exulting whisper, &ldquo;Ha! ha! my fine fellows!&nbsp; You
may look long enough for him!&rdquo; then ran downstairs at full
speed, and entered the hall.&nbsp; His mother, dressed for a
journey, stood by the table; a glance of hope and joy lighting on
her pale features, but her swollen eyelids telling of a night of
tears and sleeplessness.&nbsp; Lucy and Charles were by her side,
the front door open, and the horses were being led up and down
before it.&nbsp; Walter and Eleanor hurried up to her, but before
they had time to speak, the rebel captain dashed into the room,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Thou treacherous woman, thou shalt abye
this!&nbsp; Here! mount, pursue, the nearest road to the
coast.&nbsp; Smite them rather than let them escape.&nbsp; The
malignant nursling of the blood-thirsty Palatine at large
again!&nbsp; Follow, and overtake, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way, sir?&rdquo; demanded the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest to the coast.&nbsp; Two ride to Chichester,
two to Gosport.&nbsp; Or here!&nbsp; Where is that maiden, young
in years, but old in wiles?&nbsp; Ah, there! come hither,
maiden.&nbsp; Wilt thou purchase grace for thy mother by telling
which way the prisoners are fled?&nbsp; I know thy wiles, and
will visit them on thee and on thy father&rsquo;s house, unless
thou dost somewhat to merit forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Walter, swelling with
passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not feign, maiden.&nbsp; Thy heart is rejoicing that
the enemies of the righteous are escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not wrong there, sir,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell thee,&rdquo; said the captain, sternly,
&ldquo;thy joy shall be turned to mourning.&nbsp; Thou shalt see
thy mother thrown into a dungeon, and thou and thy sisters shall
beg your bread, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter could not endure these empty threats, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;You know you have no power to do this.&nbsp; Is this what
you call manliness to use such threats to a poor girl in your
power?&nbsp; Out upon you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the rebel, considerably surprised at
the young lady&rsquo;s manner of replying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
thus the malignants breed up their daughters, in insolence as
well as deceit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last word made Walter entirely forget his assumed
character, and striking at the captain with all his force, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Take that, for giving the lie to a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo; cried the rebel, seizing his arm.&nbsp;
Walter struggled, the hood fell back.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the
boy!&nbsp; Ha! deceived again!&nbsp; Here! search the house
instantly, every corner.&nbsp; I will not be balked a second
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed out of the room, while Walter, rending off the hood,
threw himself into his mother&rsquo;s arms, exclaiming, &ldquo;O
mother dear, I bore it as long as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear rash boy!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;But is
he safe?&nbsp; No, do not say where.&nbsp; Thanks, thanks to
heaven.&nbsp; Now I am ready for anything!&rdquo; and so indeed
her face proved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All owing to Rose, mother; she will soon be back again,
she&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll say no more, for fear.&nbsp; He left
love&mdash;duty&mdash;Rose left all sorts of greetings, that I
will tell you by and by.&nbsp; Ha! do you hear them lumbering
about the house?&nbsp; They fancy he is hid there!&nbsp; Yes, you
are welcome&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush, Walter! the longer they look the more time
he will gain,&rdquo; whispered his mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh this
is joy indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, I found out Walter, and said not one
word,&rdquo; interposed Lucy; but there was no more opportunity
for converse permitted, for the captain returned, and ordered the
whole party into the custody of a soldier, who was not to lose
sight of any of them till the search was completed.</p>
<p>After putting the whole house in disorder, and seeking in vain
through the grounds, the captain himself, and one of his men,
went off to scour the neighbouring country, and examine every
village on the coast.</p>
<p>Lady Woodley and her three younger children were in the
meantime locked into her room, while the soldier left in charge
was ordered not to let Walter for a moment out of his sight; and
both she and Walter were warned that they were to be carried the
next morning to Chichester, to answer for having aided and
abetted the escape of the notorious traitor, Edmund Woodley.</p>
<p>It was plain that he really meant it, but hope for Edmund made
Lady Woodley cheerful about all she might have to undergo; and
even trust that the poor little ones she was obliged to leave
behind, might be safe with Rose and Deborah.&nbsp; Her great fear
was lest the rebels should search the villages before Edmund had
time to escape.</p>

117</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Cautiously</span> stealing down stairs,
Rose first, to spy where the rebels might be, the brother and
sister reached the kitchen, where Rose provided Edmund with a
grey cloak, once belonging to a former serving-man, and after a
short search in an old press, brought out various equipments,
saddle, belt, and skirt, with which her mother had once been wont
to ride pillion-fashion.&nbsp; These they carried to the outhouse
where Edmund&rsquo;s horse had been hidden; and when all was set
in order by the light of the lantern, Rose thought that her
brother looked more like a groom and less like a cavalier than
she had once dared to hope.&nbsp; They mounted, and on they rode,
across the downs, through narrow lanes, past farm houses,
dreading that each yelping dog might rouse his master to report
which way they were gone.&nbsp; It was not till day had dawned,
and the eastern sky was red with the approaching sun, that they
came down the narrow lane that led to the little town of Bosham,
a low flat place, sloping very gradually to the water.&nbsp; Here
Rose left her brother, advising him to keep close under the
hedge, while she softly opened a little gate, and entered a
garden, long and narrow, with carefully cultivated flowers and
vegetables.&nbsp; At the end was a low cottage; and going up to
the door, Rose knocked gently.&nbsp; The door was presently
cautiously opened by a girl a few years older, very plainly
dressed, as if busy in household work.&nbsp; She started with
surprise, then held out her hand, which Rose pressed
affectionately, as she said, &ldquo;Dear Anne, will you tell your
father that I should be very glad to speak to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call him,&rdquo; said Anne; &ldquo;he is just
rising.&nbsp; What is&mdash;&nbsp; But I will not
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, do not, thank you, I cannot tell you
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose was left by Anne Bathurst standing in a
small cleanly-sanded kitchen, with a few wooden chairs neatly
ranged, some trenchers and pewter dishes against the wall, and
nothing like decoration except a beau-pot, as Anne would have
called it, filled with flowers.&nbsp; Here the good doctor and
his daughter lived, and tried to eke out a scanty maintenance by
teaching a little school.</p>
<p>After what was really a very short interval, but which seemed
to Rose a very long one, Dr. Bathurst, a thin, spare, middle-aged
man, with a small black velvet cap over his grey hair, came down
the creaking rough wooden stairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear
child,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;in what can I help you?&nbsp; Your
mother is well, I trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir!&rdquo; said Rose; and with reliance and
hope, as if she had been speaking to a father, she explained
their distress and perplexity, then stood in silence while the
good doctor, a slow thinker, considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, to hide him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he may not
be here, for this&mdash;the old parson&rsquo;s house&mdash;will
be the very first spot they will search.&nbsp; But we will
try.&nbsp; You rode, you say, Mistress Rose; where is your
horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! there is one difficulty,&rdquo; said Rose,
&ldquo;Edmund is holding him now; but where shall we leave
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us come first to see the young gentleman,&rdquo;
said Dr. Bathurst; and they walked together to the lane where
Edmund was waiting, the doctor explaining by the way that he
placed his chief dependence on Harry Fletcher, a fisherman,
thoroughly brave, trustworthy, and loyal, who had at one time
been a sailor, and had seen, and been spoken to by King Charles
himself.&nbsp; He lived in a little lonely hut about half a mile
distant; he was unmarried, and would have been quite alone, but
that he had taken a young nephew, whose father had been killed on
the Royalist side, to live with him, and to be brought up to his
fishing business.</p>
<p>Edmund and Rose both agreed that there could be no better hope
of escape than in trusting to this good man; and as no time was
to be lost, they parted for the present, Rose returning to the
cottage to spend the day with Anne Bathurst, and the clergyman
walking with the young cavalier to the place where the fisherman
lived.&nbsp; They led the horse with them for some distance, then
tied him to a gate, a little out of sight, and went on to the
hut, which stood, built of the shingle of the beach, just beyond
the highest reach of the tide, with the boat beside it, and the
nets spread out to dry.</p>
<p>Before there was time to knock, the door was opened by Harry
Fletcher himself, his open sunburnt face showing honesty and good
faith in every feature.&nbsp; He put his hand respectfully to his
woollen cap, and said, with a sort of smile, as he looked at
Edmund, &ldquo;I see what work you have for me, your
reverence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Harry,&rdquo; said Dr. Bathurst;
&ldquo;this is one of the gentlemen that fought for his Majesty
at Worcester, and if we cannot get him safe out of the country,
with heaven&rsquo;s blessing, he is as good as a dead
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, sir,&rdquo; said Fletcher, &ldquo;you had best
not be seen.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one here but little Dick, and
I&rsquo;ll answer for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came in, and Dr. Bathurst explained Edmund&rsquo;s
circumstances.&nbsp; The honest fellow looked a little perplexed,
but after a moment said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do what in me
lies, sir; but &rsquo;tis a long way across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should tell you, my good man,&rdquo; said Edmund,
&ldquo;that I have nothing to repay you with for all the trouble
and danger to which you may be exposing yourself on my
behalf.&nbsp; Nothing but my horse, which would only be bringing
suspicion on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that, your honour,&rdquo; replied Harry,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never think of waiting for pay in a matter of
life and death.&nbsp; I am glad if I can help off a gentleman
that has been on the King&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the plan was arranged.&nbsp; Edmund was to be disguised in
the fisherman&rsquo;s clothes, spend the day at his hut, and at
night, if the weather served, Fletcher would row him out to sea,
assisted by the little boy, in hopes of falling in with a French
vessel; or, if not, they must pull across to Havre or
Dieppe.&nbsp; The doctor promised to bring Rose at ten
o&rsquo;clock to meet him on the beach and bid him
farewell.&nbsp; As to the horse, Fletcher sent the little boy to
turn it out on the neighbouring down, and hide the saddle.</p>
<p>All this arranged, Dr. Bathurst returned to his school; and
Rose, dressed in Anne&rsquo;s plainest clothes, rested on her bed
as long as her anxiety would allow her, then came down and helped
in her household work.&nbsp; It was well that Rose was thus
employed, for in the afternoon they had a great fright.&nbsp; Two
soldiers came knocking violently at the door, exhibiting an order
to search for the escaped prisoner.&nbsp; Rose recognised two of
the party who had been at Forest Lea; but happily they had not
seen enough of her to know her in the coarse blue stuff petticoat
that she now wore.&nbsp; One of them asked who she was, and Anne
readily replied, &ldquo;Oh, a friend who is helping me;&rdquo;
after which they paid her no further attention.</p>
<p>Her anxiety for Edmund was of course at its height during this
search, and it was not till the evening that she could gain any
intelligence.&nbsp; Edmund&rsquo;s danger had indeed been
great.&nbsp; Harry Fletcher saw the rebels coming in time to
prepare.&nbsp; He advised his guest not to remain in the house,
as if he wished to avoid observation, but to come out, as if
afraid of nothing.&nbsp; His cavalier dress had been carefully
destroyed or concealed; he wore the fisherman&rsquo;s rough
clothes, and had even sacrificed his long dark hair, covering his
head with one of Harry&rsquo;s red woollen caps.&nbsp; He was
altogether so different in appearance from what he had been
yesterday, that he ventured forward, and leant whistling against
the side of the boat, while Harry parleyed with the
soldiers.&nbsp; Perhaps they suspected Harry a little, for they
insisted on searching his hut, and as they were coming out, one
of them began to tell him of the penalties that fishermen would
incur by favouring the escape of the Royalists.&nbsp; Harry did
not lose countenance, but went on hammering at his boat as if he
cared not at all, till observing that one of the soldiers was
looking hard at Edmund, he called out, &ldquo;I say, Ned,
what&rsquo;s the use of loitering there, listening to
what&rsquo;s no concern of yours?&nbsp; Fetch the oar out of yon
shed.&nbsp; I never lit on such a lazy comrade in my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to turn away all suspicion, the soldiers left
them, and no further mischance occurred.&nbsp; At night, just as
the young moon was setting, the boat was brought out, and Harry,
with little Dick and a comrade whom he engaged could be trusted,
prepared their oars.&nbsp; At the same time, Dr. Bathurst and
Rose came silently to meet them along the shingly beach.&nbsp;
Rose hardly knew her brother in his fisherman&rsquo;s garb.&nbsp;
The time was short, and their hearts were too full for many
words, as that little party stood together in the light of the
crescent moon, the sea sounding with a low constant ripple,
spread out in the grey hazy blue distance, and here and there the
crests of the nearer waves swelling up and catching the
moonlight.</p>
<p>Edmund and his sister held their hands tightly clasped, loving
each other, if possible, better than ever.&nbsp; He now and then
repeated some loving greeting which she was to bear home; and she
tried to restrain her tears, at the separation she was forced to
rejoice in, a parting which gave no augury of meeting again, the
renewal of an exile from which there was no present hope of
return.&nbsp; Harry looked at Dr. Bathurst to intimate it was
time to be gone.&nbsp; The clergyman came close to the brother
and sister, and instead of speaking his own words, used
these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn our captivity, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
as the rivers in the south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth
good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his
sheaves with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; answered Edmund and Rose; and they
loosened their hold of each other with hearts less sore.&nbsp;
Then Edmund bared his head, and knelt down, and the good
clergyman called down a blessing from heaven on him; Harry, the
faithful man who was going to risk himself for him, did the same,
and received the same blessing.&nbsp; There were no more words,
the boat pushed off, and the splash of the oars resounded
regularly.</p>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s tears came thick, fast, blinding, and she sat
down on a block of wood and wept long and bitterly; then she rose
up, and in answer to Dr. Bathurst&rsquo;s cheering words, she
said, &ldquo;Yes, I do thank <span class="smcap">God</span> with
all my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Rose slept at Dr. Bathurst&rsquo;s, and early in
the morning was rejoiced by the tidings which Harry Fletcher sent
little Dick to carry to the cottage.&nbsp; The voyage had been
prosperous, they had fallen in with a French vessel, and Mr.
Edmund Woodley had been safely received on board.</p>
<p>She was very anxious to return home; and as it was Saturday,
and therefore a holiday at the school, Dr. Bathurst undertook to
go with her and spend the Sunday at Forest Lea.&nbsp; One of the
farmers of Bosham helped them some little way with his harvest
cart, but the rest of the journey had to be performed on
foot.&nbsp; It was not till noon that they came out upon the high
road between Chichester and Forest Lea; and they had not been
upon it more than ten minutes, before the sound of horses&rsquo;
tread was heard, as if coming from Chichester.&nbsp; Looking
round, they saw a gentleman riding fast, followed by a soldier
also on horseback.&nbsp; There was something in his air that Rose
recognised, and as he came nearer she perceived it was Sylvester
Enderby.&nbsp; He was much amazed, when, at the same moment, he
perceived it was Mistress Rose Woodley, and stopping his horse,
and taking off his hat, with great respect both towards her and
the clergyman, he hoped all the family were well in health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I believe so, thank you,&rdquo; replied Rose,
looking anxiously at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am on my way to Forest Lea,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I bring the order my father hoped to obtain from General
Cromwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Protection!&nbsp; Oh, thanks! ten thousand
thanks!&rdquo; cried Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! it may save&mdash;But
hasten on, pray hasten on, sir.&nbsp; The soldiers are already at
home; I feared she might be already a prisoner at
Chichester.&nbsp; Pray go on and restrain them by your
authority.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask me to explain&mdash;you will
understand all when you are there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She prevailed on him to go on, while she, with Dr. Bathurst,
more slowly proceeded up the chalky road which led to the summit
of the green hill or down, covered with short grass, which
commanded a view of all the country round, and whence they would
turn off upon the down leading to Forest Lea.&nbsp; Just as they
came to the top, Rose cast an anxious glance in the direction of
her home, and gave a little cry.&nbsp; Sylvester Enderby and his
attendant could be seen speeding down the green slope of the
hill; but at some distance further on, was a little troop of
horsemen, coming from the direction of Forest Lea, the sun now
and then flashing on a steel cap or on the point of a pike.&nbsp;
Fast rode on Sylvester, nearer and nearer came the troop; Rose
almost fancied she could discern on one of the horses something
muffled in black that could be no other than her mother.&nbsp;
How she longed for wings to fly to meet her and cheer her heart
with the assurance of Edmund&rsquo;s safety!&nbsp; How she longed
to be on Sylvester&rsquo;s horse, as she saw the distance between
him and the party fast diminishing!&nbsp; At length he was close
to it, he had mingled with it; and at the same time Dr. Bathurst
and Rose had to mount a slightly rising ground, which for a time
entirely obscured their view.&nbsp; When at length they had
reached the summit of this eminence, the party were standing
still, as if in parley; there was presently a movement, a
parting, Rose clasped her hands in earnestness.&nbsp; The main
body continued their course to Chichester, a few remained
stationary.&nbsp; How many?&nbsp; One, two, three&mdash;yes,
four, or was it five? and among them the black figure she had
watched so anxiously!&nbsp; &ldquo;She is safe, she is
safe!&rdquo; cried Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, <span
class="smcap">God</span> has been so very good to us, I wish I
could thank Him enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the smoother slope to avoid encountering the baffled
rebels, Dr. Bathurst and Rose descended the steep, the good man
exerting himself that her eagerness might not be
disappointed.&nbsp; Down they went, sliding on the slippery green
banks, helping themselves with the doctor&rsquo;s trusty staff,
taking a short run at the lowest and steepest part of each,
creeping down the rude steps, or rather foot-holes, cut out by
the shepherd-boys in the more perpendicular descents, and fairly
sliding or running down the shorter ones.&nbsp; They saw their
friends waiting for them; and a lesser figure than the rest
hastened towards them, scaling the steep slopes with a good will,
precipitancy, and wild hurrahs of exultation, that would not let
them doubt it was Walter, before they could see his form
distinctly, or hear his words.&nbsp; Rose ran headlong down the
last green slope, and was saved from falling by fairly rushing
into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he safe?&nbsp; I need not ask!&rdquo; exclaimed
Walter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe! in a French vessel.&nbsp; And mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe! well! happy!&nbsp; You saw, you heard!&nbsp;
Hurrah!&nbsp; The crop-ears are sent to the right about; the
captain has done mother and me the favour to forgive us, as a
Christian, all that has passed, he says.&nbsp; We are all going
home again as fast as we can, young Enderby and all, to chase out
the two rogues that are quartered on us to afflict poor Deb and
the little ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Dr. Bathurst had descended, more cautiously, and
Walter went to greet him, and repeat his news.&nbsp; Together
they proceeded to meet the rest; and who can tell the tearful
happiness when Rose and her mother were once more pressed in each
other&rsquo;s arms!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble girl! under Providence you have saved
him!&rdquo; whispered Lady Woodley.</p>
<p>The next evening, in secrecy, with the shutters shut, and the
light screened, the true pastor of Forest Lea gathered the
faithful ones of his flock for a service in the old hall.&nbsp;
There knelt many a humble, loyal, trustful peasant; there was the
widowed Dame Ewins, trying to be comforted, as they told her she
ought; there was the lady herself, at once sorrowful and yet
earnestly thankful; there was Sylvester Enderby, hearing and
following the prayers he had been used to in his early childhood,
with a growing feeling that here lay the right and the truth;
there was Deborah, weeping, grieving over her own fault, and
almost heart-broken at the failure of him on whom she had set her
warm affections, yet perhaps in a way made wiser, and taught to
trust no longer to a broken reed, but to look for better things;
there were Walter and Lucy, both humbled and subdued, repenting
in earnest of the misbehaviour each of them had been guilty
of.&nbsp; Walter did not show his contrition much in manner, but
it was real, and he proved it by many a struggle with his
self-willed overbearing temper.&nbsp; It was a real resolution
that he took now, and in a spirit of humility, which made him
glad to pray that what was past might be forgiven, and that he
might be helped for the future.&nbsp; That was the first time
Walter had ever kept up his attention through the whole service,
but it all came home to him now.</p>
<p>Each of that little congregation had their own sorrow of
heart, their own prayer and thanksgiving, to pour out in secret;
but all could join in one thank-offering for the safety of the
heir of that house; all joined in one prayer for the rescue of
their hunted King, and for the restoration of their oppressed and
afflicted Church.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Nine years had passed away, and Forest Lea still stood among
the stumps of its cut-down trees; but one fair long day in early
June there was much that was changed in its aspect.&nbsp; The
park was carefully mown and swept; the shrubs were trained back;
the broken windows were repaired; and within the hall the
appearance of everything was still more strikingly cheerful, as
the setting sun looked smilingly in at the western window.&nbsp;
Green boughs filled the hearth, and were suspended round the
walls; fresh branches of young oak leaves, tasselled with the
pale green catkins; the helmets and gauntlets hanging on the wall
were each adorned with a spray, and polished to the brightest;
the chairs and benches were ranged round the long table, covered
with a spotless cloth, and bearing in the middle a large bowl
filled with oak boughs, roses, lilac, honey-suckle, and all the
pride of the garden.</p>
<p>At the head of the table sat, less pale, and her face beaming
with deep, quiet, heartfelt joy, Lady Woodley herself; and near
her were Dr. Bathurst and his happy daughter, who in a few days
more were to resume their abode in his own parsonage.&nbsp;
Opposite to her was a dark soldierly sun-burnt man, on whose
countenance toil, weather, and privation had set their traces,
but whose every tone and smile told of the ecstasy of being once
more at home.</p>
<p>Merry faces were at each side of the table; Walter, grown up
into a tall noble-looking youth of two-and-twenty, particularly
courteous and gracious in demeanour, and most affectionate to his
mother; Charles, a gentle sedate boy of fifteen, so much given to
books and gravity, that his sisters called him their little
scholar; Rose, with the same sweet thoughtful face, active step,
and helpful hand, that she had always possessed, but very pale,
and more pensive and grave than became a time of rejoicing, as if
the cares and toils of her youth had taken away her light heart,
and had given her a soft subdued melancholy that was always the
same.&nbsp; She was cheerful when others were cast down and
overwhelmed; but when they were gay, she, though not sorrowful,
seemed almost grave, in spite of her sweet smiles and ready
sympathy.&nbsp; Yet Rose was very happy, no less happy than
Eleanor, with her fair, lovely, laughing face, or&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is Lucy?&rdquo; Edmund asked, as he saw her
chair vacant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy?&rdquo; said Rose; &ldquo;she will come in a
moment.&nbsp; She is going to bring in the dish you especially
ordered, and which Deborah wonders at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, faithful Deborah!&rdquo; said Edmund.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did she never find a second love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, never,&rdquo; said Eleanor.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
says she has seen enough of men in her time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is grown sharper than ever,&rdquo; said Walter,
&ldquo;now she is Mistress Housekeeper Deborah; I shall pity the
poor maidens under her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will always be kind in the main,&rdquo; rejoined
Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you ever hear what became of that precious
sweetheart of hers?&rdquo; asked Edmund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanged for sheep stealing,&rdquo; replied Walter,
&ldquo;according to the report of Sylvester Enderby.&nbsp; But
hush, for enter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There entered Lucy, smiling and blushing, her dark hair
decorated with the spray of oak, and her hands supporting a great
pewter dish, in which stood a noble pie, of pale-brown,
well-baked crust, garnished with many a pair of little claws,
showing what were the contents.&nbsp; She set it down in the
middle of the table, just opposite to Walter.&nbsp; The grace was
said, the supper began, and great was the merriment when Walter,
raising a whole pigeon on his fork, begged to know if Rose had
appetite enough for it, and if she still possessed the spirit of
a wolf.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said he, as they finished,
&ldquo;now Rose will never gainsay me more when I sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For forty years our Royal throne<br />
Has been his father&rsquo;s and his own,<br />
Nor is there anyone but he<br />
With right can there a sharer be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For who better may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The right sceptre sway,<br />
Than he whose right it is to reign?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then look for no peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the war will never cease<br />
Till the King enjoys his own again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then far upon the distant hill<br />
My hope has cast her anchor still,<br />
Until I saw the peaceful dove<br />
Bring home the branch I dearly love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there did I wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the waters abate<br />
That did surround my swimming brain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For rejoice could never I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I heard the joyful cry<br />
That the King enjoys his own again!&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
